### Essential Terminologies & Analogies

- **Blockchain**: Distributed, immutable ledger.
- **Smart Contract**: Self-executing contract code.
- **Consensus Algorithm**: Mechanism for distributed agreement.
- **dApp**: Decentralized application.
- **Merkle Tree**: Data structure enabling simple and secure blockchain verification.

**Analogies**:
- Blockchain as a public transaction ledger is like a bank statement for the world((133)).
- Smart contracts are digital vending machines—automatic, unforgeable execution.
- Analytics is the pit crew monitoring real-time racecar (blockchain) performance.
