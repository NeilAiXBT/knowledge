### Logical Classification and MECE Structure of Job Interviews

A job interview process can be comprehensively explained by categorizing it into six mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) core phases: 1) Preparation Phase, 2) Introduction and Rapport Building, 3) Information Gathering, 4) Candidate’s Response and Interaction, 5) Assessment and Evaluation, and 6) Closure and Feedback. Each phase features distinct components, functions, and characteristics, ensuring complete, non-overlapping coverage of the entire lifecycle.

### Core Elements, Components, Factors, and Aspects

1. **Preparation Phase**
   - **Components:** Job analysis, resume screening, question development.
   - **Function:** Aligns the process with job and organizational requirements by setting clear standards and objectives.
   
2. **Introduction and Rapport Building**
   - **Components:** Candidate introduction, small talk, setting expectations.
   - **Function:** Reduces candidate anxiety, establishes initial communication climate, and shapes first impressions.
   
3. **Information Gathering**
   - **Components:** Behavioral, situational, and technical questions, observation of candidate responses.
   - **Function:** Collects data about job-specific competencies, personality, and fit.
   
4. **Candidate’s Response and Interaction**
   - **Components:** Verbal responses, nonverbal cues (e.g., eye contact, posture), interaction with interviewers.
   - **Function:** Facilitates authentic communication, allowing deeper insight into candidate suitability.
   
5. **Assessment and Evaluation**
   - **Components:** Scoring rubrics, competency mapping, interviewer scoring.
