### MECE Principle and Logical Structuring in AI Job Interview Preparation

The MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principle provides a robust foundation for structuring, classifying, and categorizing the comprehensive set of Q&As and dialogues required for an AI job interview situation. By adhering to MECE, each category is clearly separated, ensuring there is no overlap (mutually exclusive) between sections or items, and every essential area is fully covered (collectively exhaustive). This approach not only supports clear thinking and thorough analysis but also aids in the design of effective classification systems for interview topics and skills, which is critical when handling complex AI-related problems or scenarios.

Below, each category is numbered, clearly divided, and logically classified as per MECE guidelines.
