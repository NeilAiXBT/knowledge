1. **Proof of History (PoH)**
   - **Concept/Definition:** PoH is a cryptographic clock that timestamps and orders events((113)).
   - **Function/Purpose:** It reduces consensus latency by offering a verifiable “order of events”((246)).
   - **Analogy/Example:** Like a radio station time-stamping news tickers so every listener knows exactly when each story arrived; PoH ensures no debate on transaction ordering.
   - **Characteristic:** Sequential hash chain (verifiable delay function), core for throughput.

2. **Proof of Stake (PoS) Consensus**
   - **Concept/Definition:** Validators are elected based on stake to propose/validate blocks((111)).
   - **Function/Purpose:** Energy-efficient consensus; aligns economic incentives with honest network behavior.
   - **Analogy/Example:** Like voting power proportional to shareholding; more SOL staked = higher block proposal chance.
   - **Characteristic:** Fast finality, robust against Sybil attacks, lower energy use than PoW.

3. **Sealevel Parallel Runtime**
   - **Concept/Definition:** Parallel execution engine for smart contracts.
   - **Function/Purpose:** Executes thousands of non-conflicting transactions simultaneously for high throughput.
