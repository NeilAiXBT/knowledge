# Project Conventions

1. **Accuracy with Citations**  
   - Always provide accurate answers with line-by-line source citations in Markdown format
   - Example: `[Source: filename.md, line 42]`

2. **Document Structure**  
   - Every document should include:
     - Introduction section explaining purpose and scope
     - Conclusion section summarizing key points
   - Example structure:
     ```markdown
     # Introduction
     [Purpose and scope]

     # Main Content
     [Detailed information]

     # Conclusion
     [Summary and key takeaways]
     ```

3. [Add more conventions as needed...]
