Typescript Reserved Keywords

### Understanding Identifiers and Keywords in TypeScript

In TypeScript, **identifiers** are user-defined names used to reference various programming constructs such as variables, functions, classes, and other entities within a program. These identifiers must adhere to specific naming conventions that are largely similar to those in JavaScript, given TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. Conversely, **keywords** are a predefined set of reserved words that possess special meaning within the language's syntax and semantics. Due to their special meaning, keywords cannot be used as identifiers for variables, functions, or class names. The compiler interprets keywords as specific instructions or definitions, and using them as identifiers would lead to syntax errors and ambiguity in the code.

### General Characteristics of TypeScript Keywords

Keywords in TypeScript are fundamental components of the language's structure, carrying predefined meanings that dictate how the compiler interprets code. These words are essential for defining control flow (e.g., `if`, `else`, `switch`, `break`), declaring types and variables (e.g., `var`, `number`, `string`, `type`), and other language operations. A core rule in TypeScript, consistent with JavaScript, is that reserved keywords must not be employed as identifier names, ensuring the clarity and correctness of the code's interpretation.

### Inherited Keywords from JavaScript and ECMAScript

As a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript incorporates all reserved keywords from JavaScript and the ECMAScript standards. This inheritance ensures compatibility and consistency between the two languages. Examples of such inherited keywords include `break`, `case`, `catch`, `class`, `const`, `continue`, `debugger`, `default`, `delete`, `do`, `else`, `enum`, `export`, `extends`, `finally`, `for`, `function`, `if`, `import`, `in`, `instanceof`, `let`, `new`, `null`, `return`, `super`, `switch`, `this`, `throw`, `try`, `typeof`, `var`, `void`, `while`, and `with`. Furthermore, ECMAScript also includes keywords like `async` and `await` which are reserved. Using any of these inherited reserved words as identifiers in TypeScript code will result in syntax errors.

### TypeScript-Specific Keywords

Beyond the keywords inherited from JavaScript, TypeScript introduces its own set of keywords, primarily to support its advanced type system. One prominent example is the `type` keyword, which is used to define type aliases and user-defined types, giving developers greater control over type declaration and manipulation. Other TypeScript-specific keywords or those that take on a more prominent role due to typing include `as`, `any`, `number`, `string`, `module`, and `get`, which are integral to defining types, performing type assertions, and structuring modules. These additions underscore TypeScript's focus on enhancing code reliability through static type checking.

### Contextual Keywords in TypeScript

TypeScript also features **contextual keywords**, which are words that function as keywords only within specific syntactic contexts. Unlike universally reserved keywords, contextual keywords can be used as regular identifiers when they appear outside of their designated contexts, without causing conflicts or errors. This design allows TypeScript to introduce new syntax elements without unnecessarily restricting the use of common words as identifiers across all parts of the codebase. The existence of contextual keywords enables the language to evolve and add new functionalities while maintaining backward compatibility and flexibility for developers. The ability to differentiate between a word being a keyword or an identifier based on its context is a sophisticated parsing mechanism that helps TypeScript extend JavaScript's capabilities without entirely breaking existing code patterns.

### Recent Changes and Additions to Reserved Keywords

TypeScript continuously evolves, with new releases often introducing breaking changes or refinements to existing features, which can include additions to the reserved keyword list or changes in how certain language constructs behave. A significant addition occurred with **TypeScript 3.0**, where the `unknown` keyword was reserved to function as a built-in type, enhancing type safety by representing values whose type cannot be determined. This meant that `unknown` could no longer be used as an arbitrary identifier. More recently, **TypeScript 5.2** introduced the `using` keyword, facilitating a new mechanism for resource disposal, integrating with the `Symbol.dispose` protocol. This addition reflects an ongoing effort to improve resource management within the language.

Other notable breaking changes, while not always direct keyword additions, can impact how identifiers are used or how code is interpreted. For instance, in TypeScript 4.8, stricter checks were applied to type parameters under `strictNullChecks`, where type parameters were no longer considered automatically assignable to `{}`. In TypeScript 4.6, object rest expressions became more strict, dropping unspreadable members from generic objects, affecting how `...rest` variables are typed and used. TypeScript 4.5 changed the behavior of `Promise.all` and `Promise.allSettled` when unwrapping `Promise-like` types, potentially requiring adjustments to type arguments.

Furthermore, TypeScript 4.4 began to explicitly discard the `this` value when calling imported functions from CommonJS, AMD, and other non-ES module systems, aligning with ECMAScript module behavior. In TypeScript 4.1, under `--strictNullChecks`, expressions with `any` on the left-hand side of an `&&` now result in an `any` type, which can introduce new errors where `unknown` expressions were not properly checked for boolean conversion. Also in 4.1, object spreads now return types with all-optional properties to improve performance and display, moving away from strict union types for conditional spreads. These updates reflect the language's commitment to improved type inference, runtime consistency, and performance, occasionally necessitating adjustments to existing codebases and a continuous awareness of keyword and type system evolution.
