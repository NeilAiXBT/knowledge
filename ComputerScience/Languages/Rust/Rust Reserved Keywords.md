Rust Reserved Keywords

Wed Jun 25 2025

### Rust Reserved Keywords

The Rust programming language employs a distinct set of keywords that are integral to its syntax and semantics, serving specific functions within the language. These keywords are reserved exclusively for use by the language and cannot be repurposed as identifiers, such as names for functions, variables, parameters, struct fields, modules, crates, constants, macros, static values, attributes, types, traits, or lifetimes. This reservation is crucial for maintaining the language's consistency, preventing naming conflicts, and ensuring forward compatibility with future Rust versions. Rust categorizes its keywords into three primary types: strict keywords, weak (contextual) keywords, and keywords reserved for future use.

### Strict Keywords (Currently in Use)

Strict keywords are those that have a defined meaning and functionality within the Rust language and can only be used in their correct contexts. These keywords cannot be used as names for variables, function parameters, fields, variants, type parameters, lifetime parameters, loop labels, macros, attributes, or macro placeholders. They are fundamental to constructing Rust programs and are utilized for various tasks.

*   **`as`**: This keyword is used for primitive casting, for disambiguating the specific trait that contains an item, or for renaming items during imports, particularly within `use` statements.
*   **`async`**: Introduced to facilitate asynchronous programming, `async` is used to define functions or blocks that return a `Future` instead of blocking the current thread.
*   **`await`**: This keyword is employed within `async` functions to suspend execution until the result of a `Future` is available, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.
*   **`break`**: The `break` keyword provides a mechanism to exit a loop immediately, terminating its execution regardless of the loop's condition.
*   **`const`**: This keyword is used for defining **constant items** and **constant raw pointers**. Constants are immutable values known at compile time.
*   **`continue`**: The `continue` keyword allows a program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration.
*   **`crate`**: In a module path, `crate` refers to the root of the current crate, indicating an external crate linkage or a macro variable.
*   **`dyn`**: This keyword is used for **dynamic dispatch** to a trait object, enabling runtime polymorphism.
*   **`else`**: The `else` keyword serves as a fallback block for `if` control flow constructs, executing its code when the `if` condition evaluates to false.
*   **`enum`**: The `enum` keyword is used for defining an **enumeration**, a type that can be one of a defined set of variants.
*   **`extern`**: This keyword denotes **external crate, function, or variable linkage**, typically used for interoperating with code written in other languages or external Rust crates.
*   **`false`**: The `false` keyword represents the **Boolean false literal**.
*   **`fn`**: The `fn` keyword is used for **function definition** and also refers to a **function pointer type**.
*   **`for`**: This versatile keyword serves multiple purposes: it can be used for an **iterator loop**, as part of the **trait implementation syntax**, and in **higher-ranked lifetime syntax**.
*   **`if`**: The `if` keyword is fundamental for **conditional branching**, allowing code execution to depend on the evaluation of an expression.
*   **`impl`**: The `impl` keyword is used for defining **inherent and trait implementation blocks**, associating methods and associated items with a specific type or implementing a trait for a type.
*   **`in`**: This keyword is typically used for **variable binding** within patterns.
*   **`let`**: The `let` keyword is used for **binding variables**. While not explicitly listed with a detailed explanation in the provided documents, its usage is implied in discussions about variables.
*   **`loop`**: The `loop` keyword defines an **unconditional, infinite loop** that continues executing until explicitly exited by a `break` statement.
*   **`match`**: The `match` keyword is a powerful construct for **pattern matching**, allowing a value to be compared against a series of patterns to execute specific code blocks.
*   **`mod`**: The `mod` keyword is used for **module declaration**, organizing code into hierarchical units.
*   **`move`**: When applied to a closure, the `move` keyword forces the closure to **take ownership of all its captures**, rather than borrowing them.
*   **`mut`**: The `mut` keyword denotes **mutability** in references, raw pointers, and pattern bindings, allowing the value they refer to to be modified.
*   **`pub`**: The `pub` keyword denotes **public visibility** in struct fields, `impl` blocks, and modules, making items accessible from outside their defining scope.
*   **`ref`**: The `ref` keyword is used for **by-reference binding** in patterns, allowing a value to be matched by reference rather than by value.
*   **`return`**: The `return` keyword is used to **return from a function**, optionally providing a value.### Rust Reserved Keywords

*   **`self`**: With a lowercase 's', `self` refers to the **method subject** (the instance on which a method is called) or the **current module**.
*   **`static`**: This keyword is used to declare a **global variable** or a **lifetime lasting the entire program execution**.
*   **`struct`**: The `struct` keyword is used to define a **structure**, a custom data type that groups together related data fields.

*   **`unsafe`**: The `unsafe` keyword denotes **unsafe code, functions, traits, and implementations**, where the programmer takes responsibility for ensuring memory safety.
*   **`use`**: The `use` keyword is employed to **import symbols into scope**, making them accessible by their name without needing their full path. It can also specify precise captures for generic and lifetime bounds.
*   **`where`**: The `where` keyword is used for **type constraint clauses**, specifying additional bounds on generic type parameters, often found after function signatures or `impl` blocks.
*   **`while`**: The `while` keyword defines a **conditional loop** that continues executing as long as a specified Boolean expression evaluates to true.

### Weak Keywords (Contextual Keywords)

Weak keywords, also known as contextual keywords, have special meaning only in certain contexts. This means that outside of their specific contextual usage, they *can* be used as identifiers.

*   **`default`**: This keyword has special meaning, particularly when implementing traits where a default implementation for a method is provided.
*   **`macro_rules`**: This keyword is used to create custom macros in Rust.
*   **`'static`**: This is a specific lifetime keyword used for the **static lifetime**, which lasts for the entire duration of the program execution. It cannot be used as a generic lifetime parameter or loop label.
*   **`union`**: The `union` keyword is used to declare a **union**, and it is only considered a keyword when used specifically in a union declaration.
*   **`raw`**: This keyword is used for raw borrow operators, such as `&raw const expr`, and is only a keyword when matching such a form.

### Keywords Reserved for Future Use

These keywords currently do not have any functionality in the Rust language but are reserved for potential future use. The rationale behind reserving them is to ensure that current Rust programs remain forward compatible with future versions of the language by preventing developers from using these words as identifiers.

*   **`abstract`**: Reserved for future language features.
*   **`become`**: Reserved for future language features.
*   **`box`**: While not explicitly detailed in the provided documents, this keyword is generally reserved for future use related to boxing values on the heap.
*   **`do`**: Reserved for future language features.
*   **`final`**: Reserved for future language features.
*   **`gen`**: The `gen` keyword was reserved starting in the Rust 2024 edition as part of RFC #3513. Its purpose is to introduce "gen blocks" in a future release, which are intended to simplify the creation of certain types of iterators. Reserving this keyword now facilitates the eventual stabilization of `gen` blocks before the next Rust edition.
*   **`macro`**: Reserved for future language features related to macros.
*   **`override`**: Reserved for future language features.
*   **`priv`**: Reserved for future language features related to private visibility.
*   **`try`**: The `try` keyword was not a keyword in the 2015 edition but became one in the 2018, 2021, and 2024 editions. It is reserved for future use related to error handling, similar to how `?` operator currently functions.
*   **`typeof`**: Reserved for future language features.
*   **`unsized`**: Reserved for future language features related to dynamically sized types.
*   **`virtual`**: Reserved for future language features.
*   **`yield`**: Reserved for future language features, likely related to generator functions.
*   **`alignof`**: Reserved for future use.
*   **`offsetof`**: Reserved for future use.
*   **`sizeof`**: Reserved for future use.

### Raw Identifiers

Despite the existence of reserved keywords, Rust provides a mechanism called **raw identifiers** that allows developers to use any keyword as an identifier if necessary. This is achieved by prefixing the keyword with `r#` (e.g., `r#match` instead of `match`). This syntax is particularly useful for several reasons: it offers greater flexibility in choosing identifier names, enables integration with code written in other languages where these words might not be keywords, and facilitates compatibility when using libraries compiled with different Rust editions where keyword statuses might differ. For instance, if a function is named `match`, which is a keyword, attempting to compile `fn match()` would result in an error. By using `fn r#match()`, the code compiles without issues.

The `gen` keyword, reserved in the 2024 edition, is a prime example where raw identifiers become relevant. Any existing identifier named `gen` would clash with the new keyword. To address this, Rust offers the `keyword_idents_2024` lint, which can automatically modify identifiers like `gen` to `r#gen` when running `cargo fix --edition`, ensuring compatibility across editions. Developers can also manually enable this lint for migration purposes. The `check_keyword` crate, updated for Rust 2024, provides utilities to programmatically check if a string is a keyword and convert it to a safe non-keyword form using raw identifiers, highlighting that most keywords can be used as raw identifiers.
