### Introduction and MECE-Compliant Logical Grouping

Code quality evaluation dimensions (CQEDs) are foundational criteria for judging, improving, and sustaining software systems, facilitating reliability, maintainability, scalability, security, and adaptability through the software lifecycle. For maximal clarity and completeness, the CQEDs are grouped as follows (ensuring Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive—MECE):

#### Group 1: Structural Quality
1. **Readability**
2. **Maintainability**
3. **Complexity**
4. **Documentation & Style Compliance**

#### Group 2: Behavioral Quality
5. **Functional Correctness**
6. **Performance/Efficiency**
7. **Reliability**
8. **Security**

#### Group 3: Adaptability & Reusability
9. **Flexibility**
10. **Extendability**
11. **Reusability**

#### Group 4: Utility and Deployment
12. **Scalability**
13. **Testability**
14. **Portability**

### 17. Numbered List for Clarity

1. CQEDs grouped by structure, behavior, adaptability, utility [see above].
2. Each has a clear purpose, definition, function, and lifecycle phase focus.
3. Dimension operation integrates with standard workflows—dev, test, deploy, maintain.
4. Academic theories, industry best practices, and continuous improvement paradigms drive them.
5. Laws: “You get what you measure,” and “technical debt is real.”
6. Contradictions/trade-offs are inherent and must be managed contextually.
7. Enforced by static/dynamic analysis, automated testing, peer reviews, and documentation rituals.
8. Pros/cons, risks, and limitations dictate engineering strategy.
9. Interdependent and sometimes contradictory relationships govern implementation.
10. Relationships, cardinality, and comparison/summary tables clarify full picture.
11. Continuous quality investment pays dividends in reduced crises and greater agility.
