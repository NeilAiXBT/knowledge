### What is Algorithm Analysis?

Algorithm analysis is a fundamental aspect of computer science that involves evaluating the performance of algorithms and programs. It is the process of finding the computational complexity of algorithms, which includes determining the amount of time, storage, or other resources needed to execute them. The primary goal of algorithm analysis is to compare algorithms based on the amount of computing resources each algorithm uses. This process provides theoretical estimations for the required resources an algorithm needs to solve a specific computational problem. An algorithm is considered efficient if its function values are small or grow slowly compared to the growth in input size. Donald Knuth coined the term "analysis of algorithms". It is an important part of computational complexity theory, which offers theoretical estimates for the resources required by any algorithm solving a given computational problem. These estimates offer insights into suitable directions for finding efficient algorithms. The analysis of algorithms can be divided into two areas: algorithm complexity and problem complexity. Algorithm complexity considers a specific algorithm and analyzes its behavior regarding memory space, time, or other resources, while problem complexity focuses on the class of all algorithms for a particular problem and determines its minimum resource requirements.
