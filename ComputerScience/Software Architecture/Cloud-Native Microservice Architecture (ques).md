### Overview of Cloud-Native Microservice Architecture

Cloud-Native Microservice Architecture is a contemporary architectural style designed to leverage the capabilities of cloud environments by decomposing applications into small, independent, and modular services that interact through well-defined interfaces, often using lightweight protocols like REST or gRPC. This approach emphasizes dynamic scalability, extreme fault tolerance, seamless upgradeability, and rapid innovation, fundamentally transforming application development, deployment, and operations in the cloud.

### MECE-Compliant Classification of Cloud-Native Microservice Architecture

To ensure mutual exclusivity and collective exhaustiveness (MECE), the core aspects of Cloud-Native Microservice Architecture can be systematically classified as follows:
