### Classification and Logical Categorization (MECE Principle)

WebSocket can be classified rigorously for clarity and to ensure mutual exclusivity with collective exhaustivity (MECE):

1. **By Communication Model**
   - Client-Server (Full-Duplex Channel)
   - Broadcast/Publish-Subscribe Patterns
   - Peer-to-Peer (used with signaling for systems like WebRTC)

2. **By Purpose**
   - Real-time Messaging (chat, notification)
   - Data Streaming (financial tickers, sensor feeds)
   - Collaborative Applications (document editing, multi-user gaming)

3. **By Protocol Layer Role**
   - Base Transport (TCP-based)
   - Application Subprotocols (SIP/XMPP bindings, IoT protocols via WebSocket)

4. **By Security**
   - ws:// (Non-encrypted)
   - wss:// (Encrypted using TLS/SSL)

This ensures no overlap between categories and that all relevant use cases are covered.

### Analogy and Examples

1. **Analogy:**  
   - **Telephone Line Analogy:** WebSocket is like having an always-open telephone line between a client and server, enabling either party to speak at any time—unlike traditional HTTP, which is similar to sending letters that require waiting for a reply to each.
2. **Examples:**
   - **Chat Application:** New messages are pushed instantly to recipients.
   - **Stock Ticker:** Real-time price updates are “pushed” from server to multiple clients without polling.
   - **Collaborative Editing:** Multiple users' actions instantly synchronize across all clients.

### Core Elements, Components, Factors, and Aspects

1. **Core Elements and Components**
   - WebSocket URI (ws:// or wss://)
   - Handshake Mechanism (HTTP-based)
   - Message Frames (Text/Binary Frames)
   - Control Frames (Ping/Pong/Close)
   - Full-Duplex, Persistent Connection
2. **Factors and Aspects**
   - Security (Same-Origin Policy, TLS, Origin header validation)
   - Scalability (Connection management, load balancing)
   - Compatibility (Browser and protocol support)

### Core Evaluation Dimensions and Their Evaluations

| Dimension           | Metrics                                          | Sample Evaluation/Frameworks                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Latency             | Time to delivery (ms)                            | WebSocket: 15–90 ms for small messages |
| Throughput          | Messages per second, bandwidth utilization       | Higher than HTTP, esp. at >100 clients |
| Concurrency         | Maximum simultaneous connections                 | Scalable to millions with proper hardware |
| Resource Use        | CPU/memory per client                            | More efficient than HTTP polling at scale |
| Overhead            | Protocol overhead in bytes per message           | WebSocket: 3 bytes vs HTTP: >200 bytes overhead |
| Security            | Encryption, Origin validation, support for wss   | Evaluated by penetration tests |

Performance testing typically exhibits significant efficiency over traditional HTTP polling when sending high-frequency, small messages.

### Terminologies, Formulas, and Analogies

**Terminologies**
1. Handshake: The HTTP-based negotiation step at connection start.
2. Frame: Encapsulated unit of data (text/binary/control) sent over the connection.
3. Subprotocol: Application-specific protocol operating on top of WebSocket.
4. WSS: Encrypted WebSocket connection, utilizing TLS.
5. Origin Header: Identifies the requesting domain, critical in CSWSH prevention.

**Formulas**
- Bandwidth savings = (HTTP overhead bytes - WebSocket overhead bytes) × message count.
- SHA-1 handshake:  
  Sec-WebSocket-Accept = base64(SHA-1(Sec-WebSocket-Key + "258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11")).

**Analogies**
- Telephone line (full-duplex, instant): Both parties can “speak” freely.
