### The Concept of the Unconscious Mind

The **unconscious** refers to a complex of mental activities within an individual that proceed without their awareness. Philosophers have accepted the idea that much of our mental life occurs without conscious awareness for centuries. Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, proposed that such unconscious processes can profoundly affect a person's behavior even though the individual cannot report on them. Freud and his followers believed that phenomena like dreams and slips of the tongue were concealed examples of unconscious content that were too threatening to be confronted directly. Modern psychiatry continues to view the existence of unconscious mental activities as a well-established and important concept. Freud distinguished between different levels of consciousness: activities within the immediate field of awareness are termed **conscious**, such as reading an article. The retention of data easily brought to awareness is a **preconscious** activity, like readily recalling one's address when asked, even if not actively thinking about it. Data that cannot be recalled with effort at a specific time but may later be remembered are retained on an **unconscious** level, illustrated by recalling a childhood experience under hypnosis that was previously forgotten. However, some theorists, such as the early experimental psychologist Wilhelm Wundt, denied the role of unconscious processes, defining psychology solely as the study of conscious states. The concept of the unconscious, while seemingly simple, is complex and undergoes constant transformation and contestation, encompassing its early philosophical and historical influence on the modern Western self, its reworking as a computational model in social psychology and neuroscience, and counter-discourses from indigenous and postcolonial studies. Evidence of the unconscious shapes its understanding.

### Cognitive Mechanisms Underlying Unconscious Processes

Contemporary research in cognitive psychology demonstrates the significant impact of **nonconscious mental structures and processes** on an individual's conscious experience, thought, and action. Perceptual-cognitive and motoric skills become automatized through experience, thus becoming unconscious. Additionally, findings from research on subliminal perception, implicit memory, and hypnosis indicate that events can influence mental functions even when they cannot be consciously perceived or remembered. These findings suggest a tripartite division of the cognitive unconscious into truly unconscious mental processes operating on knowledge structures that may themselves be preconscious or subconscious. **Unconscious cognition** specifically refers to the processing of perception, memory, learning, thought, and language without conscious awareness. Studies of patients with language disturbances have revealed that semantic information and visual word forms, of which the patients are consciously unaware, are nonetheless capable of producing appropriate behavioral responses. Patients with severe amnestic disorders can learn tasks without any recollection of having been taught. Similar unconscious processing has been observed in patients with prosopagnosia, blindsight, commissurotomy, and anosognosia. In normal subjects, unconscious processing is evident in studies of subliminal perception, hypnosis, and the automatic behaviors of daily activity. These observations are pertinent to current concepts of parallel distributed processing and consciousness itself. Cognitive science, which encompasses cognitive psychology, neurobiology, computer science, and linguistics, has emerged as a primary means of studying the mind, and current insights into unconscious cognitive processing help explain unusual clinical phenomena encountered by neurologists.

### The Role of Implicit Memory in Unconscious Processing

Recent research indicates that the transformation of meaning structures, such as schemes and perspectives, can occur without critical reflection. This phenomenon is partly explained by **implicit memory**, which involves the unconscious development of thoughts and actions. Research in both psychology, focusing on cognition and information processing, and neurobiology, concerning the anatomy, physiology, and pathology of the nervous system, has significantly advanced the understanding of memory. Implicit memory, specifically, involves the unconscious cognitive processing of past experiences that influence our thoughts, perceptions, and actions. This contrasts with the classical model of human cognition, which viewed consciousness as higher mental processes made up of explicit (declarative) memory, holding memories, precepts, and actions for attention and rehearsal. In that classical view, nonconscious mental life, or implicit memory, was seen as only involving latent memory traces and early preattentive processes like feature detection and pattern recognition, with little influence on conscious experience. However, recent research in long-term memory has shifted this view, recognizing that a significant amount of learning and information processing occurs outside our working memory, at an unconscious level, profoundly influencing our perception of the world. Implicit memory can be received, stored, and recovered without the participation of the limbic system and outside conscious awareness. These memories tend to be long-term, consistent, and reliable, providing an array of nonconscious ways to respond to the world, shaping habits, attitudes, and preferences that, while inaccessible to conscious recollection, nonetheless influence present behavior.

### Forms of Implicit Memory

Research in psychology and brain pathology, particularly with amnesic patients, has begun to identify several forms of implicit (nondeclarative) memory that rely on various neurological systems. One form is **procedural knowledge**, which encompasses skills and habits, including perceptual and cognitive abilities, shown to be learned and improved upon outside focal awareness. Neural evidence suggests that skill and habit learning differ from declarative memory; for example, Parkinson's patients with corticostriatal system pathology show impairment in noncognitive skill tasks but little difficulty with declarative memory tasks like recall and recognition. This implies two qualitatively different memory systems: one for cognitive or declarative memory and another, involving the caudate and putamen, for noncognitive habit memory. A second form is **category-level knowledge**, which is the ability to classify information based on natural categories (e.g., plants and animals) and the implicit acquisition of rules, often found in grammar. Grammar is a particularly strong example, where individuals acquire abstract rules but are unable to articulate what guides their speech and writing. This category knowledge also operates independently of explicit (declarative) memory and may indicate a separate brain system for implicit memory. A third form is **conditioning**, involving the learning of simple conditioned responses, often seen in relation to emotions such as fear.

### Unconscious Reading: Definition and Mechanisms

Unconscious reading involves complex, rapid processes taking place beneath conscious awareness, such as the visual system extracting information to identify linguistic significance within less than 250 milliseconds of viewing a written word. This intricate process is orchestrated by a network of specialized brain regions that constantly communicate and traffic information through electrical pulses at various frequencies. Since these processes are highly automated, they operate below the level of consciousness. The primary automatic processing steps supporting reading exhibit a spatio-functional recruitment that follows bilateral-to-left and posterior-to-anterior gradients in the brain. Distinct anatomical pathways correspond to the two well-known routes for processing written language, and reliance on these neuronal pathways predicts reading skill, potentially aiding in the early identification of developmental dyslexia. Researchers have also pinpointed the perceptual boundary between conscious access for lower and higher reading processes, with results suggesting that localized neuronal oscillations mirror the "upgrading" of consciousness to a higher linguistic processing level. When individuals read in their native language, the abilities that allow them to read are almost entirely unconscious. The unconscious can also comprise acts that are merely latent and temporarily unconscious but otherwise similar to conscious ones. Studies have found strong support for the claim that **unconscious information can be processed semantically**, meaning that masked priming was significant even when non-semantic influences were minimized. However, non-semantic processing of subliminal information can also boost priming effects. Evidence suggests that unconscious information is susceptible to several conscious top-down modulations and can exert indirect control through metacognitive processes, indicating that unconscious processing extends to a sophisticated cognitive level.

### Unconscious Reading in Psychoanalytic Theory

In psychoanalytic terms, the mind's activities are presumed to be largely unconscious, a basic premise confirmed by research. Concepts of the unconscious were central to both Carl Jung's and Sigmund Freud's thinking. Various psychoanalytic theories and techniques employ different models of the unconscious, each relating to a distinct unconscious reality describable in terms of specific mental functions. Freud's **dynamic unconscious** is based on repression. The Kleinian unconscious adds notions of unconscious fantasy and splitting of the object. Wilfred Bion's conception views the unconscious as a mental function of which the subject is unaware but which can formulate thoughts and metabolize emotions. In contrast, the neuroscientific view often equates the unconscious with that of which one is simply unaware, rather than with the Freudian repressed. This distinction highlights the difference between the **dynamic unconscious** and the **emotional unconscious**, and between 'unconscious' and 'unaware'. Neurosis involves the dynamic unconscious, while psychosis alters the emotional unconscious, the entity underlying the sense of identity and the 'unaware' consciousness of existence. In psychosis, the emotional unconscious is blinded, leading to a state where the patient is conscious but lacks awareness. The dynamic unconscious is also affected in psychosis. The interpretation of unconscious activities heavily relies on psychoanalytic theory. For instance, many neurotic symptoms are believed to originate from conflicts removed from consciousness through repression.

### The Unconscious in Relation to Awareness and Control

The **unconscious mind** functions as a fully automatic process and, unlike the subconscious mind, is not available for introspection or analysis. There has been considerable interest in dissociations between performance on implicit or indirect tests and explicit or direct tests of memory. Implicit tests, such as word stem completion, are primarily thought to reflect automatic or unconscious uses of memory, while explicit tests, like cued recall, primarily reflect strategic or consciously-controlled uses of memory. Both implicit and projective tests, like the Rorschach, provide evidence of unconscious influences when they show dissociations with performance on direct tests. For example, an implicit memory test might reveal evidence of memory even when a person cannot consciously report it. However, a major challenge in interpreting these tests is relating processes to tasks, as measures of unconscious influences may not be "process pure" and can sometimes be contaminated by intentional uses of memory. This problem is particularly evident in studies of unconscious perception, where claims of contamination have historically challenged demonstrations of unconscious perception. While it is known that tests of unconscious perception can reflect aware perception and implicit memory tests can reflect intentional memory use, constructing a completely "process pure" test of unconscious influences that is never contaminated by intentional memory use may be impossible.
