Super-Right Brain Speed Reading

Mon Jun 30 2025

### Defining Super-Right Brain Speed Reading

Super-Right Brain Speed Reading is an innovative reading methodology that prioritizes comprehension by engaging the right hemisphere of the brain for holistic and conceptual information processing. Unlike conventional speed reading techniques that often focus on sequential word recognition using the left brain, this method aims to enhance understanding and retention by enabling readers to grasp entire phrases and even sentences in a single glance. The core principle of this approach is that true reading equates to comprehension, meaning the goal is to understand the meaning behind the text rather than merely decoding symbols or recognizing individual words. Key principles include concentrating on concepts and ideas through visualization, reading in meaningful chunks, prioritizing comprehension speed, maintaining relaxation, adapting speed to content, and avoiding common speed reading myths. This fundamental shift allows readers to connect new information with existing knowledge, analyze content critically, and form mental images or concepts, which significantly deepens the reading experience and facilitates memory retention.

### Origin and Proponent of the Method

The Super-Right Brain Speed Reading method is primarily developed and popularized by David Butler, a best-selling author and retired mechanical engineer. Butler's lifelong fascination with how people learn, stemming from his observations as early as third grade, led him to question traditional teaching methods and explore deeper, conceptual understandings of information. He noticed that traditional educational techniques often emphasized memorization and recitation over true comprehension. His approach focuses on leveraging the right brain's visual and holistic processing abilities, which he contrasts with the left brain's sequential word-by-word processing often relied upon in traditional speed reading. Butler's work, particularly his book "Speed Reading with the Right Brain," provides a revolutionary approach to reading faster and retaining more information by engaging the right brain. He argues that true reading speed comes from faster comprehension rather than just quicker eye movements or mechanical tricks, distinguishing his method from older speed reading techniques like the Evelyn Wood method.

### Techniques and Exercises

Super-Right Brain Speed Reading employs specific techniques and exercises designed to train the brain to process information holistically and visually. One of the primary techniques is to **read in meaningful phrases or chunks** instead of focusing on individual words. This allows the reader to capture entire phrases and sentences in a single glance, which the right brain is capable of processing more effectively. David Butler guides readers through exercises that encourage visualizing phrases as images, promoting a shift from linear word recognition to holistic phrase processing. These exercises are often presented with specially formatted texts that highlight complete phrases, making it easier to practice absorbing larger units of information at once.

Another crucial technique is **visualization and conceptualization**, where readers actively create mental images or connect new ideas to familiar experiences as they read. This engagement of the visual cortex taps into the right brain's strength in processing information holistically and rapidly, which not only increases reading speed but also enhances comprehension and retention. The method encourages readers to let go of the need to understand every single word and instead focus on grasping the overall meaning and context of the text. This approach naturally helps in reducing subvocalization (the internal sounding out of words), a common habit that slows down reading speed. By training the brain to process ideas visually and conceptually, the need for internal speech diminishes, improving efficiency.

The method also stresses the importance of **adopting the mindset of a right-brain reader**, which involves cultivating curiosity and an open-minded engagement with the material. Readers are encouraged to adjust their pace according to the complexity of the content, slowing down for difficult material and speeding up for simpler or familiar texts to ensure continuous comprehension. Consistent practice is emphasized as essential for developing and enhancing these skills, integrating the exercises into daily reading routines for steady improvement in speed and comprehension. This approach avoids common speed reading gimmicks and instead focuses on genuine skill development through practical application and consistent effort.

### Benefits and Applications

The Super-Right Brain Speed Reading method offers numerous benefits that extend beyond simply reading faster. A primary benefit is **improved comprehension and retention** by training the brain to focus on ideas and concepts rather than individual words. This conceptual approach leads to a deeper understanding of the text, as readers are better able to grasp the broader context and meaning. Consequently, it can significantly **boost focus and concentration** by actively engaging the right brain's visualizing skills, reducing mind-wandering and distractions. Users often report not only faster reading but also clearer thinking and better memory retention of what they read.

Another significant advantage is **enhanced reading efficiency**, which means processing large amounts of information more effectively. For an average reader, who typically reads 150-200 words per minute, applying speed reading techniques can increase this to 500-600 words per minute, and even up to 700-800 words per minute at maximum speed, without sacrificing comprehension. This efficiency saves time, allowing individuals to consume more information in a shorter period. The method also helps in overcoming common reading habits such as internal vocalization (subvocalization) and unnecessary regressions, which are major obstacles to reading efficiency.

The applications of Super-Right Brain Speed Reading are broad and diverse, making it valuable for various demographics and contexts. It is particularly beneficial for:
*   **Students**: To enhance academic performance through efficient reading of textbooks and study materials.
*   **Professionals**: To process large volumes of work-related documents, reports, and emails more efficiently.
*   **Anyone looking to consume information more efficiently**: Whether for leisure reading, self-improvement, or staying informed in the rapidly advancing information age.

Platforms like Superead offer structured training stages, video lessons, and a vast library of e-books to facilitate practice and application of these skills. These resources enable users to read quickly on screens, reduce subvocalization, improve focus, and learn faster, effectively integrating the skill into daily life. The consistent application of these techniques can lead to significant personal and professional growth by providing a more effective method of learning and information processing.

### Effectiveness and Expert Opinions

The effectiveness of Super-Right Brain Speed Reading, particularly as articulated by David Butler, focuses on the premise that reading speed genuinely increases when comprehension speed improves. This approach diverges from traditional speed reading methods that often prioritize eye movement exercises, which can lead to superficial scanning without true understanding. The method is generally well-received by users who report positive results in both reading speed and comprehension. For instance, a college student pursuing neuroscience reportedly increased their reading speed from 230 words per minute (wpm) to 450 wpm after reading Butler's book, while also comprehending and remembering more from complicated textbooks. Another user doubled or tripled their reading speed without losing comprehension, reaching speeds of 350+ wpm from an initial 250 wpm.

While the principles of engaging the right brain for holistic processing are supported by neuroscientific understanding of brain functions, direct rigorous scientific studies specifically validating David Butler's Super-Right Brain Speed Reading program are not explicitly detailed in the provided documents. However, the concept that the right hemisphere plays a role in language comprehension is recognized in neuroscience. Some expert opinions, such as those from Jim Kwik (a prominent brain coach), also advocate for techniques that boost communication between both hemispheres of the brain to increase comprehension, such as the "Infinity Technique" which is claimed to increase eye strength and cross-hemisphere communication. Mindvalley's "Super Reading" program by Jim Kwik, while distinct, guarantees to double reading speed and comprehension, with reports from users seeing improvements by at least three times their base reading rate, for example, from 249 wpm to 804 wpm, or even over 950 wpm.

However, some skepticism exists in the broader speed reading community. Some sources critique speed reading programs that claim to teach students to read much faster without reducing comprehension, suggesting such claims often do not work according to research. Criticisms also point to books in this genre being repetitive and overly long, with some authors refuting all other techniques as if their own is the only correct one. Despite these criticisms, the practical feedback from many users indicates that focusing on comprehension first, visualizing ideas, and reading in phrases can lead to genuine and attainable improvements in reading skills.
