### Understanding PhotoReading: A Comprehensive Overview

PhotoReading is a distinctive technique developed by Paul Scheele that purports to significantly enhance reading speed and comprehension by leveraging the entire mind system, often bypassing traditional word-by-word reading methods. This approach claims to allow individuals to process information at an astonishing rate, sometimes cited as high as 25,000 words per minute, by "mentally photographing" the printed page. Unlike conventional speed reading, which aims to accelerate sequential reading, PhotoReading emphasizes a non-linear, multi-pass method that engages subconscious processing. The core idea is that the brain can absorb and retain information much faster and more efficiently when not constrained by conscious, verbal processing, treating words as visual objects to be seen and understood holistically rather than sequentially.

### Origins and Historical Development of PhotoReading

The PhotoReading technique was developed by Paul R. Scheele, who is also the co-founder of Learning Strategies Corporation. Scheele initiated his work in Human Resource Development in 1975, and PhotoReading was specifically developed in 1985. In 1986, Learning Strategies Corporation obtained a license as a Private School from the Minnesota Department of Education to teach this innovative course. This licensure process required adherence to sound business practices and the submission of a comprehensive curriculum document for state review. The PhotoReading book itself was initially published in 1993, with a fourth edition released in 2007, and the PhotoReading home study program was introduced in 1995. Over the decades, the PhotoReading program has seen significant evolution, being taught in 12 languages and 40 countries, with certified instructors in 35 countries.

### The Five-Step PhotoReading System

PhotoReading operates on a structured, multi-phase system, typically outlined in five core steps that collectively aim to maximize information absorption and comprehension.

The first step is **Preparation**, which involves establishing a clear purpose for reading the material and entering a relaxed, focused state of mind. This phase primes the conscious and unconscious mind for the information to be processed. The importance of preparation is to explicitly state the goal of reading, enabling the unconscious mind to work toward finding the desired information.

The second step is **Previewing**, where the reader quickly surveys the material to gain a general overview and identify key elements. This includes reviewing the table of contents, preface, introduction, chapter outlines, headings, subheadings, graphic illustrations, bulleted points, and any bolded or highlighted text. The purpose of previewing is to create a mental framework and discover "trigger words" that indicate important concepts, helping the reader decide if further engagement with the material is necessary.

The third and most distinctive step is **PhotoReading** itself, often referred to as the PhotoFocus phase. In this stage, the reader enters a state of profound relaxation, often called the Theta State, which purportedly opens up the right brain to access unconscious memory. The PhotoReader then rapidly flips through each page, typically 1 to 2 seconds per page, using a "soft" or diverged gaze without consciously focusing on or reading the words. The aim is to "mentally photograph" each page, allowing the information to be processed at a preconscious level and stored in the deeper memory of the inner mind.

The fourth step is **Postviewing** (or Postview). This phase involves exploring various sections of the text that address the reader's initial intention and noting key points and questions. It also includes allowing for an "incubation" period, typically 20 minutes to 24 hours, during which the subconscious mind organizes the absorbed information.

The final step is **Activation**, which makes the acquired knowledge consciously accessible and usable. This involves various techniques such as asking questions about the material, summarizing, creating lists, mind mapping, and "super reading" or "dipping" into sections that attract attention. Rapid reading is considered one of the ways to activate what has been learned, allowing the reader to scan and read the text quickly, skipping familiar sections and slowing down for unfamiliar, desired information.

### Claims and Reported Benefits of PhotoReading

Proponents of PhotoReading assert numerous benefits, primarily revolving around increased efficiency and capacity for information processing. A central claim is the ability to read at extraordinary speeds, up to 25,000 words per minute, enabling a user to process a 250-300 page book in under five minutes. This is presented as a method to efficiently process and understand large volumes of information without conventional speed reading, winning praise from individuals dealing with information overload.

Specific benefits highlighted include reading more easily with better understanding, improving memory, sharpening concentration, and increasing productivity. Users may also experience enhanced intuition, development of true potential, and the ability to create more time in their day by getting through information at least three times faster. For students and researchers, PhotoReading is particularly valuable as it allows them to consult many more external sources and process their usual materials more quickly. The technique is also promoted as a way to filter information, identifying the most relevant 4% to 11% of content that holds the core meaning of a text.

Testimonials from users suggest that PhotoReading can transform how one learns, enabling quicker knowledge acquisition and reducing stress. Some users report success in academic settings, turning failing grades into passing ones and significantly improving their study efficiency. The method is described as providing tools to extract key ideas, making reading more enjoyable and efficient, especially for non-fiction books.

### Scientific Evaluation and Critiques

Scientific evaluations of PhotoReading have yielded controversial results, with a notable study conducted for NASA in 1999. This preliminary analysis, led by Dr. Danielle S. McNamara, aimed to objectively examine PhotoReading's effectiveness. The study involved a PhotoReading trainee (the principal investigator herself) and an expert user. The findings indicated no benefit from using the PhotoReading technique; claimed rapid reading rates were not observed, and reading rates were generally comparable to normal reading. Furthermore, the PhotoReading expert showed an increase in reading time and a decrease in text comprehension when using the technique compared to normal reading. Comprehension accuracy specifically decreased by 30% for conceptual questions and 10% for text-based questions when PhotoReading was used. The study concluded that successful comprehension using PhotoReading should not be possible based on accepted theories of reading comprehension, as skilled reading involves active, conscious, and strategic processing.

The NASA study also pointed out that PhotoReading leads to a false sense of confidence in comprehension. The overconfidence may stem from the previewing phase, which provides a superficial understanding and primes concepts, creating a sense of déjà vu that is mistaken for actual memory. Additionally, self-hypnosis techniques used to relax and make self-statements reinforce the belief that PhotoReading works, despite a lack of actual comprehension.

Learning Strategies Corporation, Paul Scheele's publisher, has rebutted the NASA study, citing several methodological flaws. They argued that the study had an extremely limited number of participants (only two, including the researcher herself), raising concerns about researcher bias and subject numbers impacting validity. The rebuttal also highlighted that the researcher's stated bias against PhotoReading, explicitly stating that "successful comprehension using the PhotoReading technique should not be possible," rendered the study non-objective. Furthermore, the study's PhotoReading instructor was never verified as certified by Learning Strategies, and the reading times advertised for PhotoReading are calculated solely on the PhotoFocus phase, excluding other phases of the process, which was admitted by the instructor during the workshop.

Overall, while PhotoReading claims exceptional results, independent scientific evidence supporting its efficacy at claimed speeds with high comprehension remains limited and controversial.

### Diverse User Experiences and Testimonials

User experiences with PhotoReading are varied, encompassing strong advocacy and profound skepticism. Many enthusiastic users report positive outcomes, describing PhotoReading as a sophisticated and underrated learning system. Experienced PhotoReaders claim it has changed their lives, leading to improvements in concentration, memory, and an ability to gain insights from large volumes of information. Some attest to achieving a "reading paradigm shift," allowing their creative (right) brain to process text and read faster. Users have successfully applied the techniques for professional development, such as studying for computer-related certifications or understanding departmental disciplines for HR and clinical trials, noting that it made material feel familiar even before re-reading it normally. These individuals emphasize that dedicated practice and an open mind are crucial for success. For some, mind mapping, a technique integrated into PhotoReading, has been particularly useful for note-taking and material integration, leading to longer recall and easier review.

However, a substantial number of users express doubt and disappointment. Many find the claim of 25,000 words per minute to be unrealistic or impossible, pointing out that the world speed reading record is much lower, around 1,500 words per minute. Critics suggest that PhotoReading, at its core, is akin to advanced skimming and that any perceived benefits might derive from the previewing and activation steps, rather than the unique "PhotoReading" phase itself. Some report that PhotoReading does not provide conscious retention of content, requiring further "activation" steps to recall specific information, which feels more like studying than effortless absorption. There are also sentiments that the method kills the enjoyment of reading, particularly for novels or texts where immersion is desired, as it focuses on extracting core ideas rather than experiencing every word. Some reviewers warn against exaggerated marketing, noting that a significant portion of the official materials is dedicated to hyping the method rather than providing concrete instruction. Overall, success appears highly dependent on individual dedication and the type of material being read, with non-fiction often cited as more suitable than fiction.

### Available Resources for Learning PhotoReading

Numerous official resources are available for individuals interested in learning and mastering the PhotoReading technique. The foundational resource is Paul Scheele's book, often titled "The PhotoReading Whole Mind System" or "Photoreading: Read with Greater Speed, Comprehension, and Enjoyment to Absorb Complete Books in Minutes". This book details the five-step PhotoReading process and its underlying principles. Scheele has also authored other related books like "Natural Brilliance" and "Drop Into Genius," which complement the PhotoReading system.

For a more structured learning experience, various courses are offered. The "PhotoReading Digital Home Study Course" is available from Scheele Learning Systems, often in Main and Deluxe versions. These digital courses typically include audio recordings, video files from live seminars, a digital course manual, and specialized Paraliminal recordings like "The Memory Supercharger" and "PhotoReading Activator" to aid in learning. Some versions offer coaching support and a money-back guarantee.

In addition to digital courses, live workshops and seminars are conducted globally, providing intensive, hands-on training. These workshops aim to teach the techniques and help participants integrate PhotoReading into their daily lives, sometimes incorporating ontological training to address mental barriers to learning. For those preferring audio learning, Paul Scheele's "PhotoReading Personal Learning Course" was also available in an audio cassette format. These resources collectively provide comprehensive pathways for individuals to learn and apply the PhotoReading system, with a strong emphasis on consistent practice for mastery.
