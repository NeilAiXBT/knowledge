Questioning Reading is a fundamental strategy where readers actively engage with a text by formulating questions prior to, during, and following reading to enhance comprehension, clarify meaning, and cultivate critical thinking abilities. This practice transforms reading from a passive activity into an active and dynamic interaction between the reader and the text. It serves as a crucial method for fostering understanding and promoting deeper engagement with written material, which is vital for academic success and overall cognitive development.

### Classification Criteria for Questioning Reading Levels

Questions in 'Questioning Reading' are categorized into three distinct levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced, based on the cognitive complexity required for their answers. This classification aligns with hierarchical models of learning objectives, such as Bloom's Taxonomy, which progresses from simple factual recall to more complex cognitive processes. The criteria for each level ensure they are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE), providing a structured approach to fostering reading comprehension.

**1. Basic Level (Remembering/Literal Comprehension)**
This level involves recalling or recognizing information directly stated in the text, focusing on surface-level understanding. Questions typically use "who, what, when, and where" to elicit factual details, similar to remembering names or dates from memory. The primary cognitive process is remembrance, without requiring interpretation or analysis.

**2. Intermediate Level (Understanding, Applying, Analyzing/Interpretive Comprehension)**
At this stage, readers are expected to comprehend the material by interpreting, translating, summarizing, and applying information to new situations. This level moves beyond mere recall, requiring students to explain ideas in their own words, make inferences, and identify connections between different parts of the text. Questions often involve "why, how, or what if," prompting readers to delve into implied meanings and logical relationships.

**3. Advanced Level (Evaluating, Creating/Applied Comprehension)**
The highest level of questioning demands sophisticated cognitive processes such as critical evaluation, synthesis, and the generation of new ideas or perspectives based on the text. This involves appraising information, judging its value, critiquing arguments, and designing original concepts. Advanced questions encourage readers to form judgments, defend positions, and creatively extend the text's concepts beyond its explicit content. These questions foster higher-order thinking abilities and core literacies, which are crucial for deep learning. Research indicates that high-challenge questions, particularly those using "why" and "how" (wh-adverbs), lead to more linguistically complex responses from students and promote deeper comprehension.
