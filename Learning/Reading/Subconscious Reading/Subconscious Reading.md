### The Subconscious Mind in Reading and Cognition

The subconscious mind is a critical component of human mental processes, influencing thoughts, emotions, and behaviors without immediate conscious awareness. It functions just beneath the surface of conscious awareness, orchestrating automatic behaviors such as decoding text, recognizing vocabulary, and processing grammar during reading. This part of the mind encompasses a vast reservoir of thoughts, feelings, memories, desires, and automatic bodily functions that shape our perceptions and actions. Unlike the conscious mind, which handles active awareness and logical reasoning, the subconscious operates silently and unconsciously, affecting our experiences without deliberate control. It serves as a storehouse for information and experiences absorbed throughout life, forming beliefs, habits, and responses to various stimuli. In a psychological context, the subconscious exists in the mind but is not immediately available to consciousness. Some sources state that up to 95% of all cognition occurs in the subconscious mind, meaning most actions and decisions are made without conscious control. This profound influence of the subconscious is likened to the larger, unseen portion of an iceberg, with the conscious mind being only the tip.

### The Three Layers of the Mind in the Reading Process

Speed reading is considered a sophisticated cognitive process involving the interplay of the conscious, subconscious, and unconscious layers of the human mind. This model, comprising three interconnected layers, has been influential across psychology and philosophy. The conscious mind manages immediate awareness and deliberate cognitive functions, such as interpreting meaning, drawing comparisons, and applying critical analysis when reading. It allows for focused engagement, enabling readers to annotate, highlight, and comprehend complex material.

The subconscious mind streamlines the reading process by recognizing the structure of academic writing, understanding technical terms through context, and applying prior learning. Once trained, it intuitively guides the eyes across the page, facilitating fluent and intuitive reading. Techniques like previewing, skimming, and scanning are most effective when the subconscious is prepared to anticipate context and structure. Much of the absorption and integration of non-fiction material happens subconsciously, leading to new ideas and connections emerging days or weeks after engaging with a text, seemingly out of nowhere. For instance, the subconscious might link a current study with past ones, allowing for deeper integration.

At the deepest level, the unconscious mind holds instinctual drives, emotional imprints, and symbolic representations, subtly influencing how information is received and internalized. Though not readily accessible to introspection, unconscious processes can evoke affective responses or associative recall that shape interpretation in reading. An inexplicable preference or resistance to certain themes may stem from unconscious content, emphasizing reading's psychological depth. This layer reacts to content on a deeper level; for example, a chapter on addiction might stir latent emotions or associative memories, affecting retention and emotional engagement even without conscious awareness.

### Scientific Evidence and Observations of Subconscious Reading

Scientific research indicates that the unconscious brain can perform complex tasks, including reading and arithmetic, before conscious awareness. Studies conducted at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem involved over 300 student participants who were exposed to words and equations unconsciously using a technique called Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS). CFS involves presenting a static image to one eye while rapidly changing pictures flash in front of the other, causing the changing pictures to dominate awareness, allowing the static image to register subliminally before becoming conscious.

In one part of the study, participants were shown static phrases or sentences masked by flashing shapes. Participants pressed a button when they became aware of the words, which usually took about a second. Intriguingly, negative phrases like "human trafficking" and jarring sentences such as "I ironed the coffee" registered quicker than positive expressions or coherent phrases like "I ironed clothes". Researchers suggest these results indicate that the sentences were fully read and comprehended subconsciously, with surprising phrases breaking suppression faster because of their unexpected nature.

Another experiment examined the unconscious brain's processing of math problems. Using CFS, participants were subliminally exposed to three-digit equations, such as "9 − 3 − 4," for two seconds or less. When subsequently shown a number and asked to read it aloud, participants were quicker to pronounce the correct answer to the equation they had subconsciously seen. For instance, after seeing "9 − 3 − 4," they were faster to say "2" than "3," suggesting subconscious problem-solving.

These findings suggest that humans may be able to unconsciously perform tasks typically associated with consciousness, such as learning, forming intuitions, and even complex, rule-based operations. Psychology researcher Ran Hassin stated that these results imply current theories about unconscious processes need revision to address how such capabilities might contribute to solving mysteries of human consciousness. Neuroimaging research also supports that the depth of thought depends on its processing pathway, differentiating conscious and unconscious thoughts. While the pathway of the subconscious mind is difficult to define, it appears to share elements of both conscious and unconscious information processing routes.

### Techniques to Enhance and Utilize Subconscious Reading

Various techniques can enhance or utilize the power of the subconscious mind in reading, aiming to improve speed, comprehension, and retention. One fundamental approach is **priming the mind**, which involves preparing the mind to receive and integrate information by pre-exposing it to relevant stimuli. Conscious priming, such as skimming or previewing headings, initiates a neural readiness that supports quicker and more accurate processing, acting as a cognitive map. This process, largely driven by the subconscious, forms connections and expectations upon initial exposure, facilitating faster reading and deeper comprehension in subsequent encounters. Effective priming engages all three layers of the mind: consciously setting clear intentions, subconsciously previewing texts to activate memory networks, and unconsciously creating a receptive state of mind through relaxation techniques like mindful breathing or meditation.

Another strategy involves **improving automatizations** so the subconscious can become better at reading. When reading feels difficult, it often indicates that subconscious reading habits are not good enough. While conscious effort can compensate, the subconscious is crucial for fluent and intuitive reading, as it handles text decoding, vocabulary recognition, and grammar processing automatically. To truly improve, one must first learn to consciously perform a skill correctly, and then practice it to form good subconscious habits. This means explicitly figuring out how reading works, breaking it down, and treating it as something that can be analyzed, for instance, through outlines, grammar analysis, and sentence trees. Such conscious practice teaches the subconscious, allowing skills to be used naturally and intuitively without continuous conscious effort.

**Creative engagement and visualization** are also vital for tapping into the subconscious. The subconscious is always working and seeking to make sense of information. Giving it a clear problem statement and then distancing oneself from it through physical activity, like walking, allows the subconscious to work in the background to generate solutions and ideas. Visualizing desired outcomes as if they have already happened, engaging senses and emotions, can program the subconscious to pull towards those goals. This is because the subconscious mind cannot distinguish between actual experience and imagination, taking mental scenes as real. Thomas Edison famously used a technique of napping with a metal ball to wake himself in the alpha state (a relaxed, creative state) to harness subconscious problem-solving.

Further methods include **dream analysis and journaling**, as dreams can provide glimpses into the subconscious mind, revealing underlying thoughts and feelings. Keeping a dream journal can help uncover patterns, symbols, and emotions. **Hypnotherapy** is another powerful technique, creating a state of focused attention and relaxation that opens the subconscious to modify thoughts, behaviors, and beliefs. Other techniques like free association, creative expression (drawing, writing, dancing), and paying attention to physical sensations ("gut feelings") can reveal subconscious patterns and insights. By understanding and proactively engaging with the subconscious, individuals can foster better reading efficiency, deeper comprehension, and improved intellectual performance.

### Critiques and Skepticism Regarding Subconscious Reading

The concept of "subconscious reading" and the broader role of the subconscious mind in complex cognitive tasks has faced significant critique and skepticism, particularly within academic psychology. One primary area of contention lies in the interchangeable use of the terms "subconscious" and "unconscious". While popular culture often uses "subconscious" broadly, in psychoanalytic and strict psychological discourse, Sigmund Freud, who popularized the three-layered mind model, abandoned the term "subconscious" in favor of "unconscious" by 1896. Freud argued that "subconscious" was imprecise, failing to differentiate between processes in the preconscious or unconscious mind. Charles Rycroft, a psychoanalyst, stated that "subconscious" is "never used in psychoanalytic writings".

A key critique challenges the extent to which the subconscious can perform complex, rule-based operations like reading and arithmetic. Traditionally, cognitive science viewed such computations as exclusively conscious. While recent studies, such as those using Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS), demonstrate that the unconscious mind can process short sentences and mathematical equations and even comprehend their meaning before conscious awareness, critics argue this does not equate to full, nuanced reading comprehension. The evidence often focuses on surprising or emotionally charged phrases breaking into consciousness faster, rather than robust, detailed understanding.

Some contemporary psychological research also questions the overwhelming power often attributed to the subconscious mind in shaping decisions and actions. Professor Ben Newell and David Shanks, authors of "Open Minded: Searching for Truth about the Unconscious Mind," argue that the impact of the unconscious has been overstated in modern psychological thought. They propose that the conscious mind plays a more pivotal role than previously acknowledged, shifting the narrative towards individuals being conscious authors of their actions rather than being predominantly controlled by unconscious processes. This perspective advocates for viewing the brain as a cohesive system under conscious control, rather than compartmentalizing it.

Skepticism also arises from the nature of evidence supporting claims about the subconscious, particularly in New Age and self-help literature. These claims often rely on anecdotal evidence and are susceptible to confirmation bias and selection bias, lacking falsifiability and testability. Critics, such as physicist Ali Alousi, question the measurability of the subconscious and the likelihood of thoughts affecting external reality. While psychologists acknowledge the importance of unconscious processes, they generally take a more limited view of their capabilities compared to New Age depictions. There is no scientific evidence of a "subconscious independent mind" as ingrained in popular culture. The ongoing debate calls for a nuanced exploration of how conscious and subconscious processes interact, suggesting a more integrated view of the mind rather than a strict dichotomy.

### Conclusion: Reading as a Multidimensional Cognitive Process

Reading is not merely a mechanical technique but a complex, multidimensional cognitive process that intricately involves the conscious, subconscious, and unconscious layers of the mind. While the conscious mind is responsible for deliberate analysis and critical reasoning, the subconscious plays a pivotal role in automating fundamental reading tasks such as decoding text and recognizing patterns, allowing for fluid comprehension. The unconscious layer, though not directly accessible, subtly influences emotional responses and associations, affecting how information is internalized and retained.

Although scientific studies have demonstrated the subconscious mind's capacity to process and comprehend information, including text and mathematical problems, before conscious awareness, the extent of this capability remains a subject of ongoing academic debate and skepticism. Critics emphasize that traditional psychological views often favor the "unconscious" over "subconscious" and question whether subliminal processing equates to full reading comprehension, advocating for a greater role of conscious awareness in complex tasks.

Nevertheless, by understanding the interplay of these mental layers, individuals can strategically enhance their reading performance. Techniques like priming, conscious practice to improve automatizations, relaxation, visualization, and reflective practices aim to leverage the subconscious's vast processing power for faster and deeper learning. This integrated approach allows for accelerated input while improving comprehension and recall, fostering a holistic connection to the text that encompasses cognitive, affective, and intuitive understanding. Ultimately, appreciating reading as a multidimensional experience opens doors to enhanced learning efficiency, intuitive insights, and creative synthesis, regardless of the ongoing scientific discussions about the precise boundaries of subconscious capabilities.
