### Introduction to Structured Reading

Structured Reading, commonly referred to as Structured Literacy, is an evidence-based instructional approach that encompasses all aspects of spoken language into the teaching of reading, spelling, and writing. This approach is systematic and explicit, rooted in the Science of Reading, and was originally coined by the International Dyslexia Association (IDA). It serves as a unified term to describe evidence-based principles and components crucial for effective reading and writing instruction. Structured Literacy teaching is considered the most effective method for students who face significant challenges in learning to read and spell printed words, reflecting principles similar to multisensory structured language education.

### Core Principles of Structured Reading

Structured Reading is built upon several core principles that guide its effective implementation. Instruction is **systematic** and **cumulative**, meaning that material is organized logically, progressing from simpler to more difficult concepts, with each new step building upon previously mastered knowledge. This ensures a strong foundation before more complex skills are introduced. Secondly, the instruction is **explicit**, characterized by clear and deliberate teaching, continuous student-teacher interaction, and avoiding assumptions about students' prior knowledge. This involves direct modeling, explanation, guided practice, and independent practice. Thirdly, it is **diagnostic**, meaning instruction is tailored to meet the unique needs of each student based on continuous formal and informal assessments, allowing for real-time problem-solving and adaptation. These principles collectively provide a robust framework for building a child's reading skills.

### Components of Structured Reading Instruction

Structured Reading integrates all essential language components crucial for literacy development, addressing both the "what" and "how" of instruction. These components align with the word recognition and language comprehension strands of Scarborough’s Reading Rope model.

*   **Phonology:** This refers to the sound structure of spoken language, focusing on phonemes—the smallest units of sound. Instruction helps students recognize and produce these sounds, developing phonological awareness and, more specifically, phonemic awareness—the ability to identify, segment, and manipulate individual sounds in spoken words. This oral skill is a critical predictor of reading success and is fundamental for mapping print to speech.
*   **Orthography:** This is the writing system of a language, involving the understanding that letters and letter combinations (graphemes) represent specific sounds (phonemes). Structured Literacy teaches sound-symbol association in both reading (visual to auditory) and spelling (auditory to visual) directions. It also covers patterns and conventions of print, such as syllable types and spelling rules, making the English spelling system more predictable.
*   **Morphology:** This is the study of morphemes, which are the smallest meaningful units of language, including prefixes, suffixes, and root words. Understanding morphemes is crucial for decoding, vocabulary development, and fluency, bridging the gap between alphabetic reading and comprehension.
*   **Syntax:** This governs the principles or rules dictating how words function in a sentence to convey meaning, including grammar, sentence structure, and word order. A strong grasp of syntax predicts successful reading comprehension and aids in written composition.
*   **Semantics:** This component relates to word meanings and their relationships within language. It involves vocabulary development through specific word instruction and strategies like morphemic analysis, which are essential for text comprehension and building background knowledge.
*   **Discourse:** This refers to the organization of spoken and written communication, including text structure. Students learn to understand and produce various text types (narrative, informational) and strategies like comprehension monitoring and graphic organizers to make sense of longer texts.

### Relationship with the Science of Reading

Structured Literacy is firmly rooted in the Science of Reading, which is an extensive body of scientific research providing insights into how the human brain acquires and processes information for reading. While the Science of Reading is the research foundation, Structured Literacy is the instructional approach that applies this research in the classroom. It is considered the practical application of how to actualize instructional content and methods within an educational framework. The Science of Reading informs the components of literacy that should be taught and how they should be taught, guiding Structured Literacy to ensure evidence-based practices. This approach is not merely phonics-focused but encompasses a broader range of linguistic elements to ensure comprehensive literacy development.

### Goals and Objectives of Structured Reading

The primary goal of Structured Reading is to empower students by explicitly and systematically teaching them how to decode words and comprehend texts. A core objective is to teach decoding accurately, which involves translating printed symbols into spoken words, freeing up cognitive resources for comprehension. Structured Reading aims for student **automaticity** in key literacy concepts, enabling them to focus on meaning rather than the mechanics of decoding. It explicitly teaches foundational skills, such as phonemic awareness, and higher-level literacy skills, including reading comprehension and written expression. The approach also emphasizes oral language abilities, recognizing their essential role in literacy development. Ultimately, Structured Reading seeks to make learning to read possible for a large majority of students, potentially up to 95%, significantly improving reading proficiency rates.

### Methodologies and Techniques in Structured Reading Instruction

Structured Reading instruction employs several key methodologies to deliver its systematic and explicit teaching. These include:

*   **Explicit Instruction:** This method involves clearly and directly teaching students through modeling, explaining, providing guided practice, and supporting independent practice, often following an "I do, we do, you do" sequence. Instruction is deliberate and clear, with continuous interaction.
*   **Systematic and Cumulative Instruction:** Lessons follow a planned sequence, moving from simple to complex concepts, with each new skill building on previously taught information. This ensures a strong foundation and regular reinforcement of learned concepts.
*   **Multimodal Instruction:** This technique engages multiple senses—auditory, visual, and kinesthetic-motor—to enhance learning and retention. For example, students might see a word, hear it pronounced, say it aloud, and write it.
*   **Diagnostic Teaching:** Teachers continuously assess students' progress, both informally (e.g., observation) and formally (e.g., standardized tests), to tailor instruction to individual needs. This allows for prompt intervention when students struggle.
*   **Targeted Prompt Feedback:** Immediate and specific feedback is provided to students on their performance, guiding corrections and reinforcing learning. Feedback should be affirming and delivered in a way that benefits the entire group, if applicable, to avoid singling out students.
*   **Highly Interactive Learning:** Structured Literacy requires active student participation through methods like choral responses, manipulative use (e.g., letter tiles), structured academic discussions, and collaborative activities.
*   **Scaffolding:** This involves gradually shifting responsibility from the teacher to the student, providing temporary support that is removed as the student gains proficiency.

### Benefits of Structured Reading

Structured Reading offers numerous significant benefits for students' literacy development. It is highly effective in improving reading proficiency and is particularly beneficial for students with dyslexia or other reading difficulties, although it helps all students regardless of their reading level. This approach strengthens **decoding skills** by explicitly teaching sound-symbol relationships, allowing students to accurately translate print to speech and thereby freeing cognitive resources for comprehension. It significantly boosts **reading comprehension** by systematically developing linguistic components and fostering the understanding of text meaning. **Vocabulary development** is enhanced through instruction in word meanings, relationships, and usage, supported by morphological awareness. Furthermore, Structured Reading supports **spelling and writing skills** by reinforcing the mapping of sounds to letters and understanding language conventions. The comprehensive nature of this approach, addressing all layers of language, contributes to overall **language development** and proficiency.

### Challenges and Considerations in Implementing Structured Reading

Despite its proven effectiveness, implementing Structured Reading faces several challenges. One significant challenge is the requirement for **specialized teacher training**. The effective application of Structured Literacy demands that educators have a deep understanding of its components and methodologies, which necessitates comprehensive professional development. Some critics also raise concerns that an excessive focus on explicit phonics instruction, especially in early stages, might **potentially suppress the development of fluency and prosody** or comprehension if not adequately balanced. Additionally, if not implemented thoughtfully, a highly structured approach might struggle to accommodate the **diverse learning needs of all students**, including multilingual learners, who may require differentiated instruction for specific phonemes or existing phonemic awareness in their primary language. There is also a misconception that Structured Literacy is solely about phonics, which can lead to incomplete or ineffective implementation if other crucial linguistic components are overlooked. Successfully overcoming these challenges requires robust teacher support, flexible adaptation of the framework, and a holistic understanding of all its integrated elements.

### Examples and Applications of Structured Reading

Structured Reading is widely applied across various educational contexts, demonstrating its versatility and impact. In **K-12 education**, it is a primary instructional approach for teaching young people to read, especially crucial for students in Grades K-2. It is vital for students with learning disabilities, including dyslexia, and those who struggle with language skills or are English language learners. Structured Literacy is implemented in **Māori-medium immersion schools** in New Zealand to support bilingual children with dyslexic tendencies in learning Te Reo Māori and English. Lessons often follow a consistent, structured order, including sound drills, review of previously taught concepts, introduction of new rules, and practice at sound, word, and sentence levels, integrating phonological awareness activities and spelling drills.

In higher education and professional development, Structured Reading principles are embedded. For instance, **adult literacy programs** review instruments for measuring reading, writing, and mathematics skills, which can inform structured approaches. Structured reading groups are utilized in **upper-level theology courses** to increase student engagement and facilitate deep learning, with roles patterned on principles of knowledge, understanding, and inspiration. **Teacher training** programs, such as those offered by IMSE, provide professional learning pathways to equip educators with the skills to apply Structured Literacy and Orton-Gillingham methods in classrooms. The "Teaching Reading Sourcebook" by CORE Learning serves as a comprehensive resource for educators, providing research-informed and evidence-based practices for implementing Structured Literacy. Overall, Structured Reading's systematic and explicit framework makes it applicable across all tiers of instruction, from general classroom settings to targeted interventions for students with intensive needs.
