Tue Jul 01 2025

This report provides a comprehensive classification and explanation of questions across three distinct levels of complexity: basic, intermediate, and advanced. These levels are structured around 14 fundamental question types to foster a clear understanding and progressive development of cognitive skills. The objective is to present a structured approach to questioning, utilizing concise question-and-answer pairs, complemented by simple analogies and examples for enhanced clarity.

### Fundamental Question Types

The foundation of this classification relies on 14 fundamental question types, which serve as versatile tools for inquiry across various domains and cognitive levels. These types include: **What**, **Which**, **What if**, **What if not**, **Why**, **Why not**, **5-Whys** (a technique for deep causal analysis), **5-Why-nots** (for exploring alternatives), **How**, **Where**, **Who**, **Whose**, **When**, and **How much/How many**. These types are designed to elicit different forms of information and promote various levels of thinking, from simple recall to complex critical analysis.
