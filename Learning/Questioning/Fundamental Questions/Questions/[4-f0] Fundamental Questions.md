### Overview of Fundamental Question Types and Levels

Effective communication and problem-solving hinge on the ability to ask the right questions. Questions can be categorized into various types and levels, each serving a distinct purpose in inquiry and understanding. The Fundamental Questions Method (FQM) emphasizes asking basic questions to build comprehensive understanding and critical thinking, moving beyond rote memorization. This method encourages an investigative approach to learning, starting with core inquiries like "why," "what," "who," "when," and "how".

To provide a structured approach to questioning, questions can be broadly classified into three primary levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced, based on the cognitive demand and depth of inquiry they require. This classification ensures that learning and problem-solving progress from foundational knowledge to complex analysis and innovative thinking.

*   **Basic Questions** focus on recalling or recognizing simple facts, concepts, or direct information. These questions typically involve identifying "what," "who," "when," "where," "which," "whose," and "how much/many".
*   **Intermediate Questions** delve into understanding relationships, explanations, and applications of concepts, often addressing "why," "why not," and "how".
*   **Advanced Questions** necessitate higher-order thinking, involving synthesis, evaluation, prediction, and critical analysis, commonly seen in "what if," "what if not," "5-Whys," and "5-Why-Nots" inquiries.
