### Defining "Who" Questions

"Who" questions are a specific type of interrogative sentence that begin with the word "who," primarily used to inquire about a **person or people**. Their main purpose is to elicit information concerning the **identity, roles, or characteristics** of individuals or groups. Unlike questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no," "who" questions require **informative and descriptive answers**. These questions are fundamental tools for gathering information and understanding the world around us.

### Structure and Usage of "Who" Questions

"Who" questions, like other "Wh-questions" such as "what," "when," "where," "why," and "how," are used to ask for specific information. When "who" functions as the subject of the sentence, an auxiliary verb is typically not used, and the word order often remains similar to a declarative sentence. For instance, in "Who bought this?" or "Whose phone rang?", the auxiliary verb is omitted. However, when "who" is the object of the sentence, an auxiliary verb is used. These questions are essential for effective communication and understanding, helping individuals gain important details about events or situations.

### Classification Framework for "Who" Questions

To effectively categorize and understand "who" questions, a framework based on **complexity and cognitive demand** is utilized, ensuring a MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) structure. This classification divides questions into three distinct levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced. Within each of these levels, questions are further grouped into three comprehensive contexts: **Personal and Social**, **Organizational and Operational**, and **Strategic and Systemic**. This systematic approach allows for a clear understanding of the varied applications and cognitive requirements associated with "who" questions across different scenarios.

### Basic Level "Who" Questions: Identification and Familiarity
