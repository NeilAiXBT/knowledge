### Understanding Fundamental Questions and Their Levels

Questions serve as fundamental tools for learning, investigation, and problem-solving, fostering a deeper understanding of various subjects beyond mere memorization of facts. The "Fundamental Questions Method" (FQM) emphasizes approaching learning through inquiry by asking basic questions that lay the groundwork for comprehensive understanding. This method, which is natural to human cognition, focuses on core "wh" questions such as "why," "what," "who," "when," and "how," serving as pathways to deepen understanding and critical thinking. Wh-questions, including "what," "when," "where," "who," "whom," "which," "whose," and "how," are essential for asking for specific information and cannot be answered with a simple "yes" or "no". They lay the foundation for participating in conversations, demonstrating knowledge, collecting information, and making sense of one's surroundings.

### Classification of Question Levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced

To ensure a structured and comprehensive approach to questioning, questions can be classified into three distinct levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. This classification adheres to the **Mutually Exclusive (ME)** and **Collectively Exhaustive (CE)** principles, meaning each question fits into only one category, and all possible questions are covered without overlap or gaps [Task 1]. This structured approach is vital for effective learning, assessment, and problem-solving contexts.

*   **Basic Questions**
    Basic questions are general and fundamental, aimed at gaining factual knowledge and clarifying simple information. They are typically straightforward, focusing on core concepts and ideas. Criteria for basic questions include being simple and direct, focusing on one topic or idea at a time, and often using question words like "what," "who," "when," "where," or "how much/many". They enable foundational understanding and recall.
*   **Intermediate Questions**
    Intermediate questions assess a deeper understanding and the application of basic knowledge. These questions involve analyzing relationships, processes, and cause-effect within a subject matter. They require explanations of how or why something happens, involve making connections between concepts, and go beyond mere recall to application and analysis. They are suitable for problem-solving in straightforward scenarios.
*   **Advanced Questions**
    Advanced questions are complex and demand higher-order cognitive skills such as evaluation, prediction, synthesis, and creative problem-solving. They often involve hypothetical or speculative scenarios and require considering multiple variables or perspectives. These questions challenge learners to analyze ambiguity and uncertainty, fostering critical thinking skills through inquiry.
