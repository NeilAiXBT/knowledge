### Core Elements, Components, Structure, and Context of Subconscious Learning

Subconscious learning, often referred to as **implicit learning**, is a fundamental cognitive process where individuals acquire knowledge or skills without conscious awareness or intentional effort. This process is largely driven by the **subconscious mind**, which operates beneath the surface of conscious awareness, managing involuntary processes and storing a vast amount of memories, habits, and emotions. Key components include **repetition**, where frequent exposure to information or practice helps engrain learning into the subconscious, leading to automatic actions. **Emotional connection** plays a crucial role, as intense emotions linked to learning experiences can strengthen subconscious imprinting. The **desire for identification** with peers or a larger group can also subconsciously encourage the adoption of certain behaviors or knowledge. Furthermore, techniques like **hypnosis and suggestion** can facilitate direct communication with the subconscious, bypassing conscious resistance for more efficient learning. The structure of subconscious learning results in **implicit knowledge**, which refers to skills and understandings that are difficult to verbalize but profoundly influence behavior intuitively. This learning involves the brain's enormous computational power, performing numerous processes without conscious oversight, thus enabling multitasking and automatization of skills. Ultimately, subconscious learning allows for the internalization of behaviors and knowledge, enabling them to be performed effortlessly and efficiently, making it crucial for areas like language acquisition and skill mastery.

### Related Concepts, Definitions, Functions, and Purposes

Subconscious learning encompasses the acquisition and storage of information, skills, or knowledge outside of conscious awareness, relying on the mind's ability to absorb, process, and retain data without deliberate or focused conscious effort. A closely related concept is the **subconscious mind** itself, which is that part of the mind not currently in focal awareness but actively processes and stores information that influences behavior, decisions, and thought patterns. **Implicit learning** is often used synonymously with subconscious learning, describing the incidental acquisition of complex information without conscious awareness or intent. Linguist Stephen Krashen distinguishes between 'acquisition' as a subconscious process, similar to how children learn their native language, and 'learning' as a conscious and deliberate process. Both, however, contribute to gaining knowledge but differ significantly in their levels of awareness. The functions of subconscious learning include processing and storing vast amounts of information beyond conscious perception, forming habits, intuitive judgments, and automatic skills such as riding a bike or speaking a language naturally. It facilitates adaptation and mental integration by recognizing patterns and rules without explicit awareness. Furthermore, subconscious learning supports long-term memory formation by bypassing conscious filters, enabling the retention of information absorbed in a relaxed, positive context. The primary purposes of subconscious learning are to enhance efficiency in skill acquisition by automating behaviors, thereby freeing conscious attention to focus on new tasks, and to enable learning in contexts where direct conscious attention is limited or overwhelmed. It also supports survival instincts and decision-making by rapidly interpreting stimuli subconsciously, and complements conscious learning, particularly in language acquisition, motor skills, and social behaviors.

### Types, Styles, and Characteristics of Subconscious Learning

Subconscious learning manifests in several types and styles, each with distinct characteristics and supporting evidence. A core type is **implicit learning**, which involves the unconscious acquisition of knowledge without deliberate intention or awareness. This is evident in tasks like grammar acquisition or skill mastery, where individuals learn complex patterns incidentally without explicitly knowing the rules. The knowledge acquired is typically tacit, meaning it is difficult to verbalize but strongly influences behavior and intuitive responses. A specific style is **subconscious language acquisition**, where language skills are absorbed naturally through immersion, akin to how children learn their mother tongue. This approach emphasizes simultaneous reading, listening, and speaking to engage subconscious processes, leading to automatic and fluent language use. **Subliminal or passive learning** occurs through exposure to stimuli below the threshold of conscious awareness, such as subliminal messages or passive observation, influencing memory and behavior without explicit perception. **Emotional and socially driven learning** highlights how emotional states and social desires, like the desire for identification with a group, deeply influence subconscious learning. Emotionally charged experiences are more deeply encoded into the subconscious, and social contexts can subconsciously reinforce habits and skills. Finally, **hypnosis and suggestion** represent a style that facilitates direct access to the subconscious mind, bypassing conscious resistance to enable rapid learning or behavior change, with the client remaining in control throughout the process.

The characteristics of these types include **unconsciousness**, where learning occurs without conscious intent or awareness, as shown in implicit learning experiments and language acquisition studies. It is often **incidental and passive**, happening through exposure rather than deliberate focus. **Emotional connection** is a significant characteristic, as emotional intensity enhances the encoding and retention of information subconsciously. Subconscious learning also exhibits **resistance to conscious interference** once embedded, running automatically and sometimes resisting direct conscious attempts at alteration. Despite this, it is known for its **robustness and efficiency**, enabling the automatic execution of complex skills like driving or playing an instrument. Evidence supporting these classifications comes from experimental psychology, which demonstrates performance gains without conscious awareness of learned knowledge. Linguistic research on language acquisition further supports the efficacy of subconscious acquisition strategies, showing that students learn faster and better through subconscious methods compared to traditional conscious analytical study.

### Significance of Subconscious Learning

Subconscious learning holds profound significance across various aspects of human cognition and behavior. First, it forms the **foundation of skill acquisition and habit formation**. By enabling the automation of behaviors, it frees the **conscious mind** to concentrate on novel or complex tasks, thereby significantly enhancing overall cognitive efficiency. For instance, activities like riding a bicycle or speaking a language fluently become automatic and effortless through subconscious mastery, eliminating the need for constant conscious deliberation over each movement or word. Second, its **inherent efficiency** allows it to process vast amounts of information continuously and effortlessly, leading to faster acquisition and stabilization of complex skills by integrating repeated experiences into long-term memory. Third, subconscious learning plays a critical role in **lifelong learning** by deeply embedding knowledge and skills through repeated exposure and positive emotional associations, fostering enduring learning outcomes beyond formal instruction. Fourth, it is heavily influenced by **emotions and motivation**; positive emotions like curiosity can enhance subconscious learning, while negative emotions such as fear and anxiety can impede it, affecting how well information is absorbed and habits are formed. Fifth, in **cognitive development**, particularly during early childhood, subconscious learning processes are crucial for acquiring language and social skills naturally, underscoring its foundational importance in education. Lastly, the **broad applications** of subconscious learning are evident in fields ranging from language acquisition, where subconscious training methods improve fluency and comprehension, to sports skill mastery and general educational success. Scientific studies indicate that subconscious learning mechanisms are pivotal in acquiring new skills and information, excelling at pattern recognition and habit formation. Techniques such as repetition, visualization, and hypnosis effectively engage the subconscious to enhance learning outcomes, demonstrating its practical utility.

### Internal Implementation, Working Mechanisms, Principles, and Rules

Subconscious learning relies on intricate internal mechanisms and adheres to specific principles and rules that enable the mind to acquire and process information without conscious awareness, leading to automated behaviors and skills. One core working mechanism is **pattern recognition and repetition**; the subconscious mind excels at identifying and embedding repeated patterns into neural pathways through frequent exposure, which forms habits. This allows behaviors like touch typing to become second nature after sufficient practice. **Emotional imprinting** is another crucial mechanism, where the intensity of emotions associated with experiences strengthens subconscious encoding and retention of information. Information from perceived **authority figures** has a higher chance of subconscious acceptance, bypassing critical filters. The subconscious also processes **imagery and symbolism** more effectively than abstract verbal information, responding strongly to pictures, metaphors, and visual anchors. A key principle is **homeostasis**, where the subconscious strives to maintain established patterns for psychological and physiological stability, often resisting new learning unless it aligns with existing frameworks. This contributes to why habits can be challenging to break.

The rules governing the subconscious mind are notably literal; it processes information exactly as presented, without discerning irony or negatives. For instance, if one says, "I will not go on social media today," the subconscious only hears "I will go on social media today". Therefore, it learns best through **positive affirmations and specific instructions**, requiring clear, positively framed commands. The **familiarity principle** states that the subconscious is unconsciously attracted to the known, regardless of whether it is beneficial, making well-established patterns the path of least resistance. **Beliefs formed at the subconscious level act as lenses**, framing how the world is perceived and experienced, and reinforcing consistent behavior patterns. Internally, subconscious learning occurs as implicit learning, where knowledge is acquired unconsciously through exposure and practice. The brain organizes learning in neural networks that store abstract knowledge representations, enabling transferability across related skills. Learning transitions from conscious effort to subconscious automatization through repetitive practice, where initial deliberate actions become intuitive responses. Techniques like hypnosis or suggestion can bypass conscious critical filters to directly update subconscious programming. This architectural philosophy balances **additive programming** (creating new neural templates) with a protective mechanism that filters new information through existing schemas to prevent disruption.

### Phase-Based Preconditions, Inputs, and Outputs

Subconscious learning operates through distinct phases, each requiring specific preconditions and inputs to generate particular outputs. The **preconditions** for effective subconscious learning often involve creating a state that minimizes conscious resistance and maximizes receptivity. A crucial precondition is the **initial familiarity or irreality state**, where introducing novelty can help bypass existing conscious biases, allowing the mind to accept new information more fluidly. A **low cognitive resistance** is essential, as the subconscious is additive by nature but resists direct confrontation with established programs; therefore, a gentle, stress-free learning environment is beneficial. **Emotional engagement** also serves as a precondition, as intense emotions linked to the learning experience deeply imprint information subconsciously. Consistent and abundant **repetition with consistent exposure** to stimuli supports the strengthening of neural pathways necessary for subconscious encoding. Furthermore, **multimodal sensory input synchronization**, such as combining reading with listening and speaking, is highly effective in activating subconscious learning systems. A reduction or **absence of conscious interference** is also key, often achieved through techniques like hypnosis or immersive environments that bypass critical conscious filters. Finally, the presence of **complexity and implicitness** in the learning material can stimulate subconscious pattern recognition, as complex or hidden patterns are often challenging for the conscious mind to process directly.

The **inputs** that feed into subconscious learning are diverse. These include **subliminal or supraliminal stimuli**, which are perceived without conscious awareness, such as masked words, visual cues, or subtle environmental signals. **Simultaneous multichannel data**, like reading a digital text while listening to its audio and repeating it aloud, provides comprehensive input to the subconscious. **Emotional and social cues**, such as positive associations, compliments, or the desire for group identification, enhance subconscious receptivity and learning outcomes. Additionally, **implicit patterns and environmental regularities**, encountered through repeated exposure without explicit instruction, enable the subconscious to extract underlying rules or skills.

The **outputs** from subconscious learning are manifested as various forms of knowledge and behavior. The primary output is **implicit knowledge**, which refers to skills or understandings that are intuitive, automatic responses, difficult to verbalize but significantly influencing behavior. This leads to **automatic and fluent actions**, such as effortless language speaking, mastery of motor skills, or intuitive problem-solving, all performed without conscious effort. Subconscious learning also results in the **modification of habits and behaviors**, where persistent behavioral changes occur due to the subconscious encoding of new patterns or suggestions. It fosters **enhanced cognitive and emotional associations**, improving unconscious connections between concepts that aid memory and decision-making. Finally, it can lead to **unconscious predictions and insight formation**, where the subconscious processes information to generate solutions or recognize patterns, sometimes resulting in sudden "aha" moments.

### Architectural Design Philosophy, Patterns, and Features

The architectural design philosophy relevant to subconscious learning recognizes a profound relationship between the built environment and human subconscious processes. This perspective posits that buildings are not merely physical structures but also mental mediators that influence individuals' experiences, perceptions, and emotional responses, often below conscious awareness. The design aims to stimulate subconscious reactions by crafting spaces that engage multiple senses and evoke specific emotional and bodily responses. This involves a shift from linear and balanced design thinking towards embracing **non-linear, non-uniform, and creative subconscious-inspired approaches**, allowing architectural inspiration and decisions to emerge from intuition. The concept of **embodiment and spatial narrative** is central, where architectural spaces are experienced through bodily sensations, and their qualities—such as scale, light, texture, and materials—interact with subconscious emotional states to shape a user's mental image and sense of place. This philosophy also extends to designing for **healing and well-being**, creating environments that promote psychological and physiological health by connecting occupants to nature and providing sensory stimulation that positively influences subconscious mental states.

Design patterns and features supporting subconscious learning include the integration of **spatial affordances and behavior-settings**. Affordances are environmental offerings, like a door handle that invites a touch, triggering subconscious actions, while behavior-settings are spaces encoded with expectations and meanings that regulate the inhibition or activation of behaviors. The **use of repetition, rhythm, and balance** in architectural motifs creates harmony that resonates with subconscious pattern recognition, contributing to comfort and familiarity. **Multi-sensory engagement** is crucial, with natural light, varied textures, specific colors, and acoustics stimulating multiple subconscious sensory pathways, thereby enhancing implicit learning and emotional connection. Architects also create **immersive and experiential spaces** that blur the lines between artificial and natural environments, or incorporate variable scales, fostering subconscious spatial intelligence. Finally, the use of **non-verbal symbolism and cultural references** in architectural language taps into the subconscious knowledge bases formed through cultural and habitual experiences, facilitating implicit communication and understanding of the space. This architectural approach seeks to maximize intuitive and emotional engagement, balancing subtle psychological effects with functional and aesthetic priorities.

### Contradictions, Trade-offs, and Decisions

Subconscious learning, while powerful, involves inherent contradictions, trade-offs, and necessitates specific decisions for optimal application. A primary contradiction is the **awareness paradox**: while subconscious learning is defined as occurring without conscious awareness, some research suggests that true learning might require a minimum level of awareness, creating a complex interplay rather than a simple binary distinction. This means that conscious awareness influences, but is not always required for, subconscious learning. Another contradiction arises in the **conscious-subconscious interaction**: conscious efforts to control subconscious processes can sometimes facilitate learning, yet excessive conscious interference can impede it. The **literal processing of the subconscious** also contradicts the complexity of human language, which often relies on negatives, sarcasm, and nuanced meanings; the subconscious may interpret phrases like "I will not" as "I will," requiring conscious framing strategies to communicate effectively. Furthermore, the subconscious's tendency towards **stability (homeostasis)**, which resists change, contradicts the inherent requirement for adaptability in learning new patterns.

These contradictions lead to several **trade-offs**. There is a trade-off between **speed and control**: relying on subconscious automatization enhances efficiency and speed, but it can diminish conscious oversight, potentially allowing errors to propagate if the underlying subconscious programs are flawed. The balance between **stability and flexibility** is also a trade-off; the subconscious favors familiar patterns for stability, which makes it resistant to novel learning unless significant conscious effort is invested to overcome existing routines. Another trade-off is between **conscious effort and automated processing**: conscious attention is a limited resource that can become overloaded, so offloading tasks to the subconscious through practice frees up conscious capacity, but this requires an initial investment in deliberate learning and repetition. For highly automatized subconscious skills, there is a trade-off between the **error rate and automatization**; these skills require extremely low error rates (e.g., way below 1%) to prevent cascading problems, which demands extensive and focused practice.

Decisions in leveraging subconscious learning often involve choosing when to engage conscious focus versus allowing subconscious processing, based on task complexity, novelty, and error tolerance. Strategic practice involves deciding how to balance deliberate conscious practice with repetitive subconscious automatization to optimize learning efficiency. Managing conflicting subconscious and conscious processes requires metacognitive awareness and the ability to modify deeply held subconscious patterns. Qualitatively, guidelines emphasize increasing self-awareness, using positive and clear inputs, employing emotionally engaging contexts, and allowing sufficient time for subconscious integration through practice and rest. Quantitatively, guidelines suggest aiming for high-frequency repetition until subconscious performance achieves very low error rates, monitoring reaction time and automaticity as objective indicators, and structuring practice sessions with incremental difficulty and measurable feedback.

### Cause-and-Effect Relationships

The dynamics of subconscious learning are governed by distinct cause-and-effect relationships.

*   **Repetition + Familiarity <-enable-> Strong Subconscious Encoding**: Repeated exposure to stimuli and the subconscious mind's preference for familiar patterns collectively lead to the strong encoding of information. This process establishes robust neural pathways, forming the basis for habits and automatic responses.
*   **Emotional Intensity <-verb(s)-> Emotional Imprinting <-verb(s)-> Deep Learning**: When experiences or information are associated with strong emotions, the subconscious mind imprints them more deeply, leading to enhanced retention and more profound learning.
*   **Authority Signal <-verb(s)-> Authority Recognition <-verb(s)-> Subconscious Acceptance**: Information presented by a perceived authority figure triggers the subconscious to accept it more readily, effectively bypassing conscious critical filters.
*   **Visual Input <-verb(s)-> Imagery Processing <-verb(s)-> Enhanced Encoding**: The subconscious mind is wired for pictures and imagery; therefore, using visual symbols, metaphors, or mental images leads to more efficient processing and encoding of abstract ideas.
*   **Conscious Practice <-verb(s)-> Subconscious Automatization**: Initial deliberate practice and sustained conscious effort over time result in skills and tasks shifting from conscious control to automatic, subconscious execution. This frees up conscious attention for other activities.
*   **Existing Beliefs <-verb(s)-> Perception Filtering <-verb(s)-> Behavior**: Subconscious beliefs, formed from past experiences, act as filters that shape how new information is perceived and processed, ultimately influencing an individual's behavior and reactions.
*   **Hypnosis/Suggestion <-verb(s)-> Bypass Conscious Filter <-verb(s)-> Subconscious Reprogramming**: Techniques like hypnosis or targeted suggestions can bypass the conscious critical filter, allowing for direct modification or reprogramming of subconscious beliefs and patterns.

### Interdependency Relationships

Subconscious learning is characterized by complex interdependencies where various factors mutually influence each other, often without conscious awareness.

*   **Conscious Learning <-leads to transfer via practice-> Subconscious Learning**: Conscious learning provides the initial input and deliberate practice, which then enables the transfer and automatization of skills into the subconscious realm. This interdependency is typically a one-to-many relationship, where a single conscious learning effort can lead to multiple subconscious behaviors.
*   **Emotional/Authority Signals (M) <-influence-> Subconscious Encoding (1)**: Multiple emotional intensities and various signals from authority figures collectively influence and strengthen a single subconscious program or belief system. This highlights how the quality and nature of emotional and social inputs shape what is deeply embedded subconsciously.
*   **Repetition + Familiarity <-enable-> Strong Subconscious Encoding**: The subconscious mind's preference for familiarity, coupled with consistent repetition of information, creates a powerful synergy that enables robust and lasting subconscious encoding of patterns and habits.
*   **Subconscious Beliefs <-filter-> Perception and Behavior**: Subconscious beliefs act as a lens through which an individual perceives the world and reacts to it. This is a bidirectional relationship, as ongoing experiences and new perceptions can, over time, reinforce or subtly modify existing subconscious beliefs.
*   **Hypnosis/Suggestion <-bypass-> Conscious Resistance <-facilitates-> Subconscious Reprogramming**: Hypnosis and direct suggestion techniques are interdependent with conscious resistance; they work by circumventing the conscious mind's critical faculties, which then facilitates direct reprogramming of the subconscious. This illustrates how overcoming one barrier enables another process.
*   **Social Interactions <-> Subconscious Learning Processes**: Learning is an inherently social process, and subconscious mechanisms are profoundly influenced by interpersonal relationships. Dynamic interactions within social contexts lead to mutual influence, often at a subconscious level, affecting the acquisition of social skills and norms.
*   **Cognitive Frameworks <-> Emotional States <-> Subconscious Learning Outcomes**: Cognitive understanding and emotional states are deeply interdependent in shaping subconscious learning outcomes. For example, positive emotions can accelerate learning and retention, while cognitive attention can direct what emotional associations are formed subconsciously, creating a complex feedback loop.

### Cardinality-Based Relationships

Cardinality-based relationships describe the quantitative correspondence between different elements within subconscious learning.

1.  **1:M (One-to-Many) Relationship**:
    *   **One Conscious Learning Effort to Many Subconscious Behaviors/Skills**: A single instance of focused, conscious learning or practice can result in the development and automatization of multiple related subconscious behaviors or skills. For example, consciously learning to play a musical scale can lead to multiple subconscious improvements in finger dexterity, rhythm recognition, and intuitive phrasing.
    *   **One External Stimulus to Many Subconscious Associations**: A single, repeated external stimulus can become associated with multiple subconscious memories, emotions, or automatic responses. For instance, a particular scent might trigger a variety of pleasant or unpleasant memories and feelings.

2.  **M:1 (Many-to-One) Relationship**:
    *   **Many Emotional/Authority Inputs to One Subconscious Program**: Various emotional experiences, social cues, or messages from multiple authoritative sources can converge to influence and shape a single subconscious program or belief. For example, consistent positive feedback from parents, teachers, and peers (multiple inputs) can solidify a child's single subconscious belief in their academic competence.
    *   **Many Sensory Inputs to One Perceptual Experience**: The brain's cross-sensory correspondence means information from multiple senses (e.g., vision, touch, taste) is unified to create a single, coherent subconscious percept.

3.  **M:N (Many-to-Many) Relationship**:
    *   **Multiple Conscious Inputs to Multiple Subconscious Outputs**: This represents a complex, networked interaction where various conscious learning activities contribute to the formation of multiple subconscious skills, and conversely, multiple subconscious processes influence various conscious outputs. For instance, engaging in diverse study methods (conscious inputs) can lead to improved problem-solving and critical thinking (subconscious outputs), while subconscious patterns of thought can influence how new information is consciously processed.
    *   **Interplay of Learning Factors and Outcomes**: Various subconscious learning factors (e.g., priming, plasticity, variance, feedback) collectively interact to influence a multitude of learning outcomes (e.g., productivity, creativity, mental capacity).

These cardinality relationships highlight the intricate and dynamic nature of subconscious learning, where inputs are transformed and integrated in complex ways, not always through simple one-to-one mappings.

### Contradictory Relationships

Subconscious learning, despite its effectiveness, is marked by several contradictory relationships that highlight the complexities of human cognition.

*   **Conscious Awareness <-> Influences but is not always required for -> Subconscious Learning**: This relationship highlights a paradox where subconscious learning is fundamentally defined as occurring without conscious awareness, yet some research suggests that a degree of conscious attention or processing may still be involved or beneficial. This implies that while full awareness is not a prerequisite, some form of conscious engagement can influence or even initiate subconscious processes.
*   **Conscious Control -can both facilitate and impede-> Subconscious Processing**: Conscious attempts to control or directly intervene in subconscious processes can paradoxically either enhance learning by setting clear intentions and providing focused practice, or impede it by creating mental blocks, overthinking, or generating anxiety. For example, explicitly trying to "figure out the rules" in artificial grammar learning can sometimes impair performance compared to incidental exposure.
*   **Complex Human Language -contradicts-> Literal Subconscious Processing**: The subconscious mind tends to interpret information literally, without understanding negatives, irony, or nuanced linguistic expressions. This stands in contradiction to the sophisticated and often indirect nature of human language, where phrases like "don't worry" might be processed by the subconscious as "worry," necessitating careful, positive framing of thoughts and instructions.
*   **Subconscious Stability <-inhibits-> Subconscious Adaptability (Learning)**: The subconscious mind has a homeostatic impulse, striving to maintain established patterns and comfort zones, which naturally inhibits its adaptability and openness to completely new ways of thinking or behaving. This creates a tension with the very nature of learning, which requires flexibility and change. Breaking old habits, for instance, involves overcoming this subconscious resistance to change.

These contradictory relationships underscore the dynamic and often counter-intuitive interplay between the conscious and subconscious minds, requiring strategic approaches to optimize learning and behavioral change.

| **Conscious Learning**      | Deliberate, focused effort to acquire new knowledge and skills.                                    | To introduce new information that can later be transferred into subconscious processing.     | Limited capacity, attention-dependent, requires conscious effort.                                       | Often involves analyzing grammar, memorizing vocabulary, and translating messages. Conscious attention is a scarce, bottleneck resource.                                                              |
| **Habit Formation**         | Process of developing automatic behaviors through repeated subconscious learning.                     | To free up conscious resources, improve efficiency, and create durable routines.              | Resistant to change, robust, often driven by repetition and positive reinforcement.                           | The subconscious has a homeostatic impulse to keep behaviors consistent with past actions.                                                                                                                   |
| **Architectural Patterns**  | Environmental cues and design elements that stimulate subconscious responses.                            | To enhance emotional and cognitive engagement, shaping behavior and perception.          | Multisensory, symbolic, rhythmic, capable of creating subconscious associations with spaces.                      | Spaces should support psychological and physiological well-being. Includes affordances and behavior-settings.                                                                                        |
| **Phase-Based Preconditions** | Conditions enabling subconscious receptivity (e.g., emotional engagement, low resistance, repetition). | To facilitate smooth subconscious encoding and acceptance of new information.            | Emotional engagement, repetition, novelty, multimodal sensory input, absence of conscious interference. | "Raising the level of irreality" or novelty can bypass conscious biases.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Outputs of Subconscious Learning** | Skills or knowledge manifested as intuitive, automatic responses, often difficult to verbalize.    | To enable efficient and effortless performance of tasks and problem-solving.             | Implicit knowledge, automatic and fluent actions, modified habits, enhanced cognitive/emotional associations. | Can include unconscious predictions and sudden insights ("aha" moments).                                                                                                                                     |
