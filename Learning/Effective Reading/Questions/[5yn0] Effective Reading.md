### Understanding Effective Reading

Effective reading is defined as the process of actively engaging with written text to understand, evaluate, and reflect on its content. It is an active process, not passive, that aims to develop learning and integrate new ideas into existing understanding. This approach allows individuals to form connections, comprehend opinions, and apply what they learn from research. When engaging in academic reading, it is crucial to interpret and analyze the material, rather than accepting everything as factual truth, which involves critical reading. Effective readers pay close attention to the author's perspective, which enriches their understanding of the world. Learning to read progresses from simply gathering facts (surface approach) to interpreting information, including subtleties like bias, assumptions, and author perspectives (deep approach).

### Main Components and Strategies of Effective Reading

Effective reading involves several key components and employs various strategies to maximize comprehension and retention. The main components of effective reading often include phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. These are considered essential for all students and are supported by research consensus. Strategies for effective reading involve active engagement with the text, monitoring comprehension, and adapting techniques based on the reading purpose. Effective readers utilize cognitive strategies to extract meaning and construct knowledge.

For example, active reading techniques include underlining or highlighting key phrases, making notes in the margins to highlight questions or thoughts, and recognizing signposts within the text like "crucially" or "most importantly". Summarizing what has been read, either without referring back to the text or by drawing upon it, also helps focus on the most important ideas. Other vital strategies include pre-reading and making predictions, reading aloud, building background knowledge, finding the main idea and supporting details, using graphic organizers, recognizing story structure, making inferences, and questioning the text. These strategies make it easier to remember, understand, and think critically about what has been read.
