### Understanding Prediction and Its Limitations

Prediction is a fundamental aspect of human inquiry and scientific endeavor, aiming to anticipate future outcomes based on available information. The ability to predict informs decision-making across various domains, from clinical prognostics to economic forecasting and technological development. However, predictions are not infallible; they are inherently subject to limitations stemming from data quality, model complexity, inherent uncertainties, and the dynamic nature of the systems being modeled. A comprehensive understanding of these limitations, often explored through "why not" questions, is crucial for developing more robust predictive models and making more informed decisions. This report aims to classify and elaborate on these crucial "why not" questions across three distinct levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced, ensuring a comprehensive and mutually exclusive categorization.

### Criteria for Classifying "Why Not" Questions

The classification of "why not" questions related to prediction into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels ensures a structured and comprehensive understanding of the topic. This approach aims for **Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive (MECE)** categorization, distinguishing questions based on their cognitive demand, the complexity of concepts involved, and the depth of required understanding.

*   **Basic Level Questions**: These questions focus on **fundamental understanding** and simple concepts related to prediction. They typically address straightforward facts or definitions, such as "What is it?" or "Why not use this simple method?". The cognitive demand for basic questions is low, primarily requiring recall or basic comprehension of foundational ideas. For instance, beginner-level questions often gauge familiarity with the fundamentals of a service and its general use cases.

*   **Intermediate Level Questions**: This category assesses the user's understanding of **application and practical use** of predictive knowledge. Intermediate questions explore "how" and "why not" in the context of applying techniques or methods, such as "Why not use this algorithm for this type of data?". These questions involve a moderate cognitive demand, requiring an understanding of principles and the application of knowledge to solve problems. They focus on assessing how to use a service to achieve basic tasks like planning and designing cloud architecture or creating applications. Intermediate questions are useful for individuals expanding their knowledge in new areas and understanding how cloud computing functions.

*   **Advanced Level Questions**: These questions delve into **complex scenarios** with multiple variables, demanding critical analysis and the weighing of trade-offs. They evaluate nuanced, experience-based considerations and often pose questions like "Why not apply this advanced technique under specific constraints?". The cognitive demand is high, requiring synthesis, evaluation, and expert-level reasoning. Advanced questions are designed to gauge complex models and critical thinking skills that correlate with the experience levels of expert practitioners in a given domain. Such questions do not require detailed reference knowledge but rather assess how to use a service to achieve specific tasks based on extensive experience.

This classification system allows for a progressive understanding of prediction, moving from foundational concepts to complex applications and critical evaluations of its limitations and challenges.
