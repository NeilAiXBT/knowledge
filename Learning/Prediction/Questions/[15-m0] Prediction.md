This report provides a comprehensive overview of "how much" and "how many" questions and their corresponding answers, categorized across basic, intermediate, and advanced levels of English proficiency. These question types are fundamental for inquiring about quantities and amounts of nouns. The choice between "how much" and "how many" depends critically on whether the noun in question is countable or uncountable. Countable nouns refer to items that can be counted individually, such as "siblings," "microphones," or "cakes". In contrast, uncountable nouns refer to things that are not typically counted as separate units and are often considered as a single mass, such as "water," "time," or "money".

### Basic Level Questions and Answers

At the basic level, questions focus on fundamental, everyday quantities that are easily identifiable as either countable or uncountable. The primary goal is to establish a clear distinction between nouns that can be enumerated and those that are measured in bulk or as concepts. The answers provided are typically direct numerical responses for countable nouns or simple quantifiers for uncountable nouns.
