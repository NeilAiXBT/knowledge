### Prediction Analysis Framework: Understanding Limitations and Enhancing Reliability

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of prediction, structured around the "5-why-not" framework to explore the inherent limitations and challenges across basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. The "5-why-not" technique is a questioning process designed to delve into the specifics of a problem or solution, peeling back layers of symptoms to reveal the root cause or solution. Developed by Sakichi Toyoda, the method asserts that by repeating "why" five times, the nature of a problem and its solution become clear. In this context, applying "why not" helps identify the reasons why perfect prediction is elusive, exploring barriers and unaddressed factors.

#### 1. Overview and Framework of Predictive Limitations

Prediction, while a powerful tool, is fundamentally limited by various factors that prevent absolute accuracy. We often encounter predictions that are overly optimistic, even when observing a pattern of previous optimistic estimates. This framework examines why we cannot always achieve perfectly accurate predictions by addressing the core challenges across three distinct levels of complexity: basic, intermediate, and advanced. These challenges include **inherent randomness**, **chaotic systems**, **incomplete data**, **unforeseen events**, and **human biases**, all contributing to predictions being **informed guesses** rather than certainties. For instance, despite advancements in technology and understanding, certain behaviors on the atomic and molecular level are still best understood using statistical mechanics, rather than precise predictions. The framework employs a structured "5-why-not" approach, which, similar to the "Five Whys" technique, systematically uncovers underlying reasons by asking a series of "why not" questions. This method ensures a comprehensive exploration of why predictions might fail or be unreliable, offering a deeper understanding of these limitations.

#### 2. Basic Level: Fundamental "5-Why-Not" Questions on Prediction

At the basic level, we address the foundational reasons why predictions are not always perfectly accurate. These questions explore the fundamental barriers to precise foresight.
