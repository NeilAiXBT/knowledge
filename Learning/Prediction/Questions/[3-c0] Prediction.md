### Classification of "Which" Questions Across Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced Levels

This report provides a comprehensive classification of "which" questions across three distinct levels of complexity: basic, intermediate, and advanced. This categorization ensures that each question type is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE), allowing for a clear understanding of the cognitive demands and contextual applications at each stage. The questions at each level are ordered by their significance, moving from foundational choices to complex analytical and critical thinking scenarios.

### Basic Level: Fundamental "Which" Questions

Basic "which" questions are designed to gauge a user's familiarity with the fundamentals of a given topic or service, their placement among other services, and general use cases. These questions primarily focus on **simple identification, preference, or factual recall** within a limited set of options, suitable for those new to a specific concept or language. They are useful for individuals with some computing experience but who are new to a specific service or cloud computing. The answers are typically short and direct, requiring minimal analysis or contextual understanding. For instance, basic questions might ask about fundamental concepts like "What's your name?" or "How old are you?". The ability to accurately respond to such questions indicates functional appropriateness, preceding the ability to respond with complete accuracy or logic.

### Intermediate Level: Contextual and Applied "Which" Questions

Intermediate-level questions are described as having **more intricate formatting and scoring options** than basic questions. These questions assess prerequisite and fundamental knowledge of complex architectures, as well as the basic understanding of how a given service functions. They focus on assessing the user's understanding of how to use a service to achieve basic tasks, such as planning cloud architecture, creating cloud applications, and maintaining secure, stable, and cost-effective cloud services. This level is suitable for individuals who understand how cloud computing works and have some familiarity with services but are expanding their knowledge into new areas. Examples of intermediate question types include Label Image (with Drag and Drop, Drop Down, or Text), Classification, Drawing, Shading, Hotspot, Image Annotation Upload, various Cloze Math and Chemistry questions (with or without images), Math/Chemistry Essay with Rich Text, and data visualization questions like Line Chart, Number Line, Dot Plot, and Line Plot. These questions require choices based on scenarios, preferences, or additional details, building on basic understanding.

### Advanced Level: Critical "Which" Questions

Advanced-level questions assess knowledge that comes with **extensive experience** with how a service or related service works, and how to use it to achieve specific tasks. These questions evaluate users on **complex concepts** and often present scenarios with multiple, sometimes competing, variables that require critical thinking to weigh trade-offs and analyze the situation. They are not designed to test encyclopedic knowledge, but rather to gauge the complex model and critical thinking correlated with expert-level practitioners. Advanced questions align with **higher Bloom's taxonomy levels** such as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Examples of advanced assessment question types include those demanding higher-level cognitive processing, such as questions with complex formatting like Desmos Math questions and interactive data analysis. Hotspot questions allow students to mark directly on images, testing practical skills. Additionally, essay questions with rich text formatting are well-suited for detailed and extended answers.
