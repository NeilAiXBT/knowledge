These questions are essential for developing initial cognitive skills, especially in educational settings like reading comprehension.

1.  What is **prediction**?
    A prediction is a statement about what might happen in the future based on what we know now. It’s like guessing the flavor of a new ice cream based on the flavors you’ve tried before.

2.  Why do we make predictions?
    We make predictions to help us prepare and understand what might occur. For example, if you see dark clouds, you might predict it will rain so you can bring an umbrella.

3.  How is **prediction** different from a guess?
    A prediction is based on facts or patterns, while a guess is made without clear reasons. If you use weather data to say it will rain, that’s a prediction; if you just randomly say “rain” without any clues, that’s a guess.

4.  What kind of information do we need to make a prediction?
    We need facts, past experiences, and patterns. For instance, knowing that every time you water a plant it grows taller can help you predict that watering it again will have a similar effect.

5.  What role does **past data** play in prediction?
    Past data helps us see trends and patterns. Think of it like looking at the history of your daily commute times to predict how long your next trip might take.

6.  Can we always predict the future accurately?
    No, because unexpected events can change outcomes. Just as a sudden storm can change your picnic plans, unpredictable events can alter our predictions.

7.  What is the difference between **prediction** and **forecasting**?
    Prediction is a general idea about what might happen, while forecasting is a more detailed, often scientific, forecast of future events. For example, predicting that it might rain is a general thought, while a weather forecast gives specific times and amounts of rain.

8.  How do predictions affect decision-making?
    Predictions help us choose the best actions. For example, if you predict that your favorite movie is going to be crowded, you might decide to go to an earlier showing.

9.  What is a **hypothesis** in relation to prediction?
    A hypothesis is an educated guess or prediction that can be tested. Imagine predicting that adding fertilizer to your garden will make your plants grow faster; this is your hypothesis that you can test by comparing your plants with and without fertilizer.

10. How do we know if a prediction is correct?
