24. **Who holds authority over future pandemic origin tracing protocols beyond Wuhan?**
    *   The **World Health Organization (WHO)** plays a central role in establishing and governing international health regulations and protocols for future pathogen origin investigations. However, its authority relies heavily on the cooperation of member states.

25. **Who engages with local Wuhan communities affected by the early outbreak?**
    *   During the COVID-19 emergency, **CPC members** were identified as key community influencers who were effective in mobilizing the affected communities. The **WHO team** also spent time meeting with managers and residents at a community administrative center in Wuhan.

26. **Who confirms lineages of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating initially in Wuhan?**
    *   A team led by **Shi Zhengli** at the Wuhan Institute of Virology was among the first to identify, analyze, and name the **genetic sequence** of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), confirming its lineage as having 96% genetic similarity to RaTG13, a bat virus. This information was uploaded to **public databases** for global scientific access.

27. **Who interfaces with Chinese military research linked to Wuhan labs?**
    *   **Matt Pottinger**, former US Deputy National Security Adviser, claimed that the **Chinese military** was conducting research in collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which had not been acknowledged by the Chinese government. This claim suggests a link between military research and the lab, though details are limited.

28. **Who coordinates global genomic data sharing that includes Wuhan virus isolates?**
    *   The **Wuhan Institute of Virology** team was among the first to upload the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus to public databases for scientists worldwide to access.
