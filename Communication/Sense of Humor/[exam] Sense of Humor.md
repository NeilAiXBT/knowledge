A sense of humor is an intuitive understanding of what is considered funny and what is not. It involves the ability to make widely appealing jokes in appropriate situations, knowing when to be humorous and when to remain serious, and also the capacity to laugh at the humorous efforts of others. Developing a sense of humor is possible and can be cultivated by consuming funny content, such as comedy movies, talk shows, and Saturday Night Live, and by understanding various humor types. Identifying and practicing specific humor types that resonate with an individual can lead to a deeper understanding of what elicits laughter and one's preferred style. Humor has been linked to increased competency, attraction, likability, and intelligence. A survey by Robert Half International indicated that 91% of executives consider a sense of humor essential for career advancement. Furthermore, research suggests that humor can significantly increase a person's chances in courtship, with men using humor nearly three times more likely to receive a phone number from female participants. Albert Einstein reportedly attributed his wisdom to a childish sense of humor. Humor serves as a social skill that can facilitate positive interactions, enable individuals to relate to peers, attract mates, and alleviate tension during stressful periods. It can be both beneficial and detrimental to social relationships, depending on its application.

### Classification of Humor Styles

Research in personality psychology, particularly through the Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ), identifies four distinct styles of humor that are generally considered mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE). These styles are self-enhancing, affiliative, aggressive, and self-defeating. The HSQ measures two main factors: whether humor is used to enhance the self or relationships, and whether it is benevolent or potentially destructive. While humor styles can vary with social context, they tend to be a relatively stable personality characteristic. Some humor styles promote health and well-being, whereas others may negatively affect mental and physical health.

### 1. Affiliative Humor

*   **Description**: Affiliative humor is a style used to enhance relationships in a benevolent and positive manner. Its goal is to bring people together by finding humor in everyday life, fostering a sense of fellowship, happiness, and well-being. This type of humor aims to reduce tension and is often characterized by spontaneity in joke-telling, witty banter, and shared laughter.
*   **Analogy**: Imagine hosting a party where you share light-hearted jokes and funny stories that make everyone feel welcome and connected, much like a cozy campfire around which everyone gathers and laughs together.
*   **Real-life Usage Examples**:
    *   Comedians such as Jerry Seinfeld, who focus on the humor in mundane, everyday life, exemplify affiliative humor.
    *   An example from a military deployment involved a soldier, Steve Wickham, joking with an older veteran named Randy about his improved fitness during a rocket attack, saying, "Randy, look at you. That gym time is paying off — you’re keeping up with us!". This lightened the spirits of those around him and reduced tension.
    *   Telling jokes, sharing funny stories, or engaging in witty banter are common examples of affiliative humor.
*   **Associated Outcomes**: Individuals who frequently use affiliative humor are more likely to initiate friendships and are less prone to being victims of bullying. In organizational settings, it has been shown to increase group cohesiveness and promote workplace creativity. Affiliative humor is associated with increased levels of explicit and implicit self-esteem, psychological well-being, emotional stability, and social intimacy. It also correlates with decreased depressive symptoms and anxiety, and individuals using this style tend to exhibit higher levels of extraversion and openness to experience.

### 2. Self-Enhancing Humor

*   **Description**: Self-enhancing humor involves maintaining a good-natured attitude toward life and the ability to laugh at oneself, one's circumstances, and life's idiosyncrasies in a constructive, non-detrimental way. It functions as a coping or emotion-regulating mechanism, allowing individuals to find the bright side of a bad situation or maintain a positive outlook during difficult times. This type of humor is primarily used to enhance the self in a positive manner.
*   **Analogy**: Think of it as having an inner smile that persists no matter the weather, a way to see the bright side of life, even when things seem gloomy.
*   **Real-life Usage Examples**:
    *   Bob Griggs, an author, found humor while waiting for his therapist, laughing at the titles of mental health books on the shelf, which he described as a "mental health train wreck". He also found humor in his situation while in a psych ward by watching funny movies or reflecting on past events.
    *   Jon Stewart of *The Daily Show* often uses self-enhancing humor by making statements such as, "Maybe I just don’t understand," or "I’m not the brightest guy".
    *   Making light of a bad situation, cheering oneself up when stressed, and being able to laugh at oneself are examples of self-enhancing humor.
*   **Associated Outcomes**: This style is associated with decreased depressive symptoms and has been shown to promote creativity and reduce stress in the workplace. It is also related to increased self-esteem, optimism, and psychological well-being, as well as lower levels of depression and anxiety. Individuals who use self-enhancing humor are more likely to exhibit extraversion and openness to experience and are less likely to exhibit neuroticism.

### 3. Aggressive Humor

*   **Description**: Aggressive humor is characterized by the use of sarcasm, put-downs, teasing, criticism, and ridicule, often at the expense of others. This style often disregards the potential impact it might have on others and can include prejudices such as racism and sexism. While it may sometimes appear playful, the underlying intent can be to harm or belittle.
*   **Analogy**: Picture a game where the goal is to outdo others by making fun of them; this kind of humor might win a laugh in the short term but can leave lasting hurt feelings.
*   **Real-life Usage Examples**:
    *   Comedians known for their aggressive style include Don Rickles and the late Joan Rivers, who employed put-downs and insults.
    *   Everyday examples include sarcastic comments, teasing, or making racist or sexist jokes.
    *   The statement "When telling jokes or saying funny things, I am usually not very concerned about how other people are taking it" is an example of aggressive humor.
*   **Associated Outcomes**: Individuals who exhibit higher levels of aggressive humor tend to score higher on measures of hostility and general aggression. This humor style is related to higher levels of neuroticism and lower levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness. Males tend to use aggressive humor more frequently than females. It causes negative results and can be detrimental to relationships, potentially increasing depression and anxiety.

### 4. Self-Defeating Humor

*   **Description**: Self-defeating humor involves the use of potentially detrimental humor towards oneself, often to gain approval from others. Individuals employing this style engage in self-disparaging humor, where laughter is frequently at their own expense. This humor may manifest as pleasing others by being the "butt" of the joke and is sometimes seen as a form of denial, used as a defense mechanism to hide negative feelings about oneself.
*   **Analogy**: Imagine telling a joke about your own clumsy mistakes so that others feel sorry for you; this is a way to appear likable by willingly laughing at your own shortcomings.
*   **Real-life Usage Examples**:
    *   The late comedian Rodney Dangerfield's persona, epitomized by phrases such as "I don’t get no respect" and "I was an ugly baby," illustrates self-defeating humor.
    *   Making fun of one's own weaknesses, blunders, or faults to gain acceptance or covering up problems by joking around so that even close friends do not know how one truly feels are examples of self-defeating humor.
*   **Associated Outcomes**: A variety of negative outcomes are associated with self-defeating humor. Individuals who use this style more frequently show increased depressive symptoms, higher levels of neuroticism, and lower levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness. It is linked to higher levels of depression, anxiety, psychiatric symptoms, lower self-esteem, and increased bullying victimization. Self-deprecating humor is also associated with difficulty in emotional regulation, borderline personality, increased suicidal thinking, reduced resilience, and stronger negative stress responses. It can erode mental toughness by reducing control, emotional regulation, self-confidence, self-efficacy, and feelings of social competence, while increasing self-criticism. This humor style is generally associated with impaired social function and loneliness.
