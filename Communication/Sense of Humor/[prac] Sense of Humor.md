### Classification of Sense of Humor

Sense of humor, a multifaceted concept, can be systematically classified into distinct categories to provide a comprehensive understanding of its various forms and functions. This classification helps in analyzing how humor is perceived, expressed, and utilized in different contexts.

**Core Humor Styles (Psychological Framework)**
This framework categorizes humor based on its use and impact, often measured by tools like the Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ).
1.  **Affiliative Humor**: This style involves using jokes and funny stories to bring people together, enhance social interaction, and ease tension within a group. It aims to create a sense of fellowship and well-being, similar to the everyday comedy of Jerry Seinfeld.
2.  **Self-Enhancing Humor**: Individuals using this style maintain a positive outlook by finding humor in everyday situations and even in difficult circumstances, often good-naturedly targeting themselves. It functions as a coping mechanism, helping to reduce stress and maintain a cheerful attitude.
3.  **Aggressive Humor**: This style includes put-downs, insults, sarcasm, teasing, or ridicule directed at others, often used at someone else's expense. While some may find it funny, it can be detrimental and used to threaten or psychologically harm others.
4.  **Self-Defeating Humor**: This involves making oneself the target of jokes or putting oneself down to gain approval or avoid conflict, sometimes undermining self-esteem. It can be a way to hide negative feelings about oneself, although it may make the person seem more approachable.

**Fundamental Types Based on Vulnerability Highlighted**
This categorization reflects the type of human vulnerability that is most prominently highlighted in the humor.
1.  **Physical Humor**: This type often involves exaggerated physical actions, mishaps, or visual gags, such as slapstick comedy.
2.  **Emotional Humor**: Humor that plays on feelings, such as practical jokes designed to startle or tease.
3.  **Cognitive Humor**: This category encompasses intellectual humor that relies on wordplay, puns, paradoxes, or wit, requiring mental engagement.
4.  **Social Humor**: Humor that targets societal norms or relationships, often used to critique or bond over shared social experiences.

**Traditional Humor Theories**
These theories provide a philosophical and psychological basis for understanding why certain things are funny.
1.  **Superiority Humor**: Laughter arises from feeling superior to someone else's misfortune, flaw, or perceived foolishness.
2.  **Incongruity Humor**: This theory suggests that humor emerges from unexpected juxtapositions, contradictions, or a mismatch between expectations and reality.
3.  **Relief Humor**: Humor acts as a release of tension, stress, or psychological energy, often after a period of suspense or discomfort.

**Popular Humor Types**
These are common forms of humor observed in daily life and media.
1.  **Slapstick Humor**: Exaggerated physical movements and actions like pratfalls and double-takes are used to deliver humor.
2.  **Deadpan or Dry Humor**: Humor delivered with a flat, unemotional tone, where the amusement comes from the contrast between the statement and the expression.
3.  **Observational Humor**: Comedy based on pointing out and laughing at the absurdities and quirks of everyday life.
4.  **Dark Humor**: Finds comedy in morbid, tragic, or taboo subjects, often used to cope with difficult realities.
5.  **Satirical Humor**: Uses exaggeration, irony, and absurdity to criticize society, politics, or human behavior, often with a serious underlying message.
6.  **One-Liner Humor**: Delivers a setup and punchline in a single, snappy sentence, often relying on wordplay or unexpected twists.
7.  **Hyperbolic Humor**: Exaggerates a situation to an extreme, often ridiculous, level while maintaining a normal tone.
8.  **Anecdotal Humor**: Relies on telling a personal story with comedic elements, building to a surprising or absurd punchline.

### Explanation of Sense of Humor

A "sense of humor" is fundamentally the ability to perceive and appreciate what is funny, rather than necessarily being funny or comical oneself. It is a personality trait that enables an individual to recognize humor and appreciate a joke. While it differentiates from being inherently funny, these aspects often go hand-in-hand. Having a good sense of humor means an intuitive understanding of what is amusing, and it also involves the capacity to find joy, laughter, and happiness in various situations. It allows individuals to see the lighter side of things and not take themselves too seriously, even in challenging circumstances. This trait is essential for human experience, as it helps people cope with difficult situations, reduce stress, and foster positive emotions.

For example, when Alex Trebek, the host of "Jeopardy", demonstrated a great sense of humor in his work, it reflected his ability to navigate situations with lightness and wit. Similarly, librarians who use humor in their work show their capacity to find amusement even in the quiet environment of a library. It's about recognizing the absurdities of life and sharing that amusement with others, which contributes to overall well-being and social connection.

### Core Concerns, Typical Environments, and Common Products Related to Sense of Humor

The core concerns regarding a sense of humor center on its role in perceiving amusement, appreciating jokes, and offering a lighter perspective to others. It is recognized as a vital component for building social interactions, fostering group cohesion, and serving as a coping mechanism for stress and adversity. This ability is also closely tied to emotional well-being and overall quality of life.

Typical environments where a sense of humor is developed and utilized include:
1.  **Home and Family Settings**: Humor development begins in infancy, with babies responding to funny noises and facial expressions, and toddlers enjoying physical humor like peek-a-boo. Family life is enriched by shared laughter, with parents acting as humor models and creating a humor-rich environment.
2.  **Workplace Environments**: A culture that welcomes and supports humor is beneficial, as it can reduce stress, improve mood, and increase productivity. Humor in the workplace is considered an important leadership tool, helping to build trust, boost morale, and facilitate better relationships.
3.  **Social Interactions**: Humor is a universal human experience that plays a fundamental role in social bonding and making connections. It can defuse tense situations and serve as a "social lubricant".

Common products and services that leverage humor often appear in marketing and entertainment:
1.  **Marketing and Advertising**: Brands use humor to create positive associations, resonate with audiences, and stand out. This includes wordplay, inside jokes, playful humor, and surreal humor. Examples include Spotify's Wrapped campaign, State Farm's humorous ads, and Old Spice's quirky marketing.
2.  **Entertainment Media**: Comedy movies, talk shows, and television series are common sources for consuming humorous content. Humorous literature, joke books, and comics also serve as products for humor appreciation.
3.  **Consumer Goods**: Products like soft drinks, food, snacks, candy, health and beauty items, and toys are often considered well-suited for humorous advertising.

### Use Cases for Sense of Humor

The application of a sense of humor extends across various domains, particularly in leadership, organizational culture, and interpersonal relations. Organizations and leaders adopt humor for compelling strategic reasons.

**Use Cases:**
1.  **Leadership Effectiveness**: Leaders who use humor appropriately are perceived as more competent and motivating, leading to increased employee engagement. Humor allows leaders to reduce stress and fear, especially in challenging situations, giving others permission to be less serious.
2.  **Workplace Culture and Environment**: Humor contributes to a collegial work environment, fostering a positive workplace culture and increased productivity. It serves as a pattern disruptor that allows connecting different ideas and encourages creative thinking.
3.  **Employee Engagement and Well-being**: Humor can lead to a lighter mood, reduced stress, and improved mental health among employees. It also builds a greater sense of belonging and boosts morale.
4.  **Team Building and Relationships**: Humor enhances social interactions, accelerating trust and fostering stronger relationships among colleagues and leaders. It can break down barriers and create a more united team culture.
5.  **Conflict Resolution**: Humor can effectively defuse conflicts and lighten tense situations, making disagreements more manageable and leading to happier resolutions.

**Adopting Companies and Organizations, and Reasons for Adoption:**
While specific company names outside of marketing examples are not frequently provided in the documents, the principles suggest a broad adoption across various sectors.
*   **Best Buy, Etsy, Jet Blue**: These companies are noted for embracing fun and humor as core cultural values. Their reasons for adoption stem from recognizing humor's power to build trust, foster creativity, and boost morale.
*   **General Organizations**: Businesses value humor for its ability to strengthen workplace culture, improve communication, and increase employee performance. CEOs often prefer employees with a sense of humor, perceiving them as more intelligent and likable.

### Core Frameworks, Tools, Libraries, and Protocols Associated with Sense of Humor

The academic and practical study of sense of humor employs various frameworks, tools, and emerging protocols to understand its complex nature.

**Core Frameworks:**
1.  **Traditional Humor Theories**: These foundational theories explain the underlying cognitive and emotional mechanisms of humor.
    *   **Incongruity Theory**: Humor arises from the realization of a mismatch or contradiction between expectations and reality, such as a horse walking into a bar and being asked "why the long face". This is a broad category encompassing various forms like puns, satire, and anachronistic humor.
    *   **Superiority Theory**: Humor derived from a sense of triumph or feeling superior to others, often seen when laughing at someone else's misfortune or perceived foolishness. This can also include self-deprecating humor where the teller feels superior to their past self.
    *   **Relief Theory**: This theory posits that humor provides a release of psychological tension or anxiety, often through the unexpected resolution of a stressful situation.
2.  **Humor Styles Framework (Martin et al., 2003)**: This widely used framework categorizes individual humor use based on whether it is adaptive or maladaptive, and whether it targets oneself or others. The four styles are affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating.

**Tools and Libraries (Measurement Instruments):**
These instruments are primarily self-report questionnaires designed to quantify different aspects of humor.
1.  **Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ)**: Developed by Rod Martin and Patricia Doris (2003), this 32-item inventory measures the four humor styles (affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, self-defeating) based on a two-factor model: self-enhancement/relationships with others and benevolent/detrimental intent. It helps assess the impact of humor on well-being and relationships.
2.  **Multidimensional Sense of Humor Scale (MSHS)**: Created by Thorson and Powell (1993), it combines elements from other scales to assess humor production, coping humor, appreciation, and attitude toward humor.
3.  **Situational Humor Response Questionnaire (SHRQ)**: Developed by Martin and Lefcourt (1984), this 18-item questionnaire assesses how often individuals smile, laugh, or show amusement in various situations.
4.  **Coping Humor Scale (CHS)**: Also by Martin, Mittu, and Lefcourt (1983), this 7-item survey specifically assesses how participants use humor to cope with stress.
5.  **Sense of Humor Questionnaire (SHQ)**: Proposed by Sven Svenbaks in 1974, it evaluates reactivity to humor, attitude towards humorous people, and openness to amusement.

**Protocols:**
While direct protocols are less explicitly detailed for broad humor development, the concept of a "Self-initiated humor protocol" is mentioned in the context of AI agent studies as a structured approach for individuals to learn and apply humor. This suggests that humor, similar to other skills, can be cultivated through deliberate practice and systematic application.

### Phase-Based Lifecycle Workflows for Sense of Humor

The development of a sense of humor is a dynamic process that unfolds in distinct phases throughout an individual's life, from infancy to adulthood. Each phase is characterized by different cognitive and social abilities, influencing what one perceives as funny and how humor is expressed.

1.  **Infancy (Birth to ~9 months)**: This initial phase involves a biological capacity for laughter and responsiveness to basic physical stimuli. Babies react to facial expressions, funny noises, and tickling, often mimicking adult joy through smiles.
2.  **Toddlerhood (~9 months to 2-3 years)**: During this period, children begin to appreciate the element of surprise and simple physical humor, such as peek-a-boo or unexpected tickles. They also start to deliberately create humor, for example, by intentionally pointing to the wrong body part or trying to walk in adult shoes. Imagination begins to appear, enabling children to engage in more active humor production.
3.  **Preschool Years (3-5 years)**: Preschoolers find humor in literal incongruities and absurdities, often delighting in things that are "not right," like a dog that meows. This stage also commonly features the emergence of "potty words" and bathroom humor, as children become more aware of bodily functions and social norms.
4.  **Early Elementary Years (5-8 years)**: Children at this age begin to actively tell simple jokes and appreciate basic wordplay, exaggeration, and slapstick. The pleasure of knowing the punchline and repeating jokes is common.
5.  **Late Elementary to Adolescence (9-18 years)**: As cognitive abilities mature, children develop a more sophisticated understanding of humor, including puns, riddles, and more complex forms of wordplay. They start to grasp non-literal humor, sarcasm, and teasing, often using humor to connect with peers and navigate social situations. Humor also becomes a tool for coping with adversity.
6.  **Adulthood (18+ years)**: In adulthood, a sense of humor evolves into a personalized style influenced by one's personality, experiences, and cultural background. Adults learn to use humor for complex social functions, such as leadership, stress reduction, and maintaining relationships. While the frequency of laughter may decrease with age, appreciation for certain humor styles, like self-enhancing humor and incongruity resolution, may increase.

Throughout these phases, the development of humor is a learned skill, shaped by upbringing, social interactions, and exposure to various forms of comedy.

### Goals, Resources, Strategies, and Costs per Lifecycle Phase

Developing a sense of humor involves specific goals, leveraging available resources, implementing effective strategies, and incurring various costs across each lifecycle phase.

**1. Infancy (Birth to ~9 months)**
*   **Goals**: To trigger natural laughter and elicit joyful responses to physical stimuli.
*   **Resources**: Caregivers (parents, guardians) are the primary resource.
*   **Strategies**: Engage infants with playful interactions, make funny faces and noises, and use gentle tickling or "raspberries".
*   **Costs**: Minimal, primarily the caregiver's time and affectionate attention.

**2. Toddlerhood (~9 months to 2-3 years)**
*   **Goals**: Foster appreciation for surprise and simple physical humor; encourage early attempts at humor production.
*   **Resources**: Caregivers, interactive games, and common household objects.
*   **Strategies**: Play peek-a-boo, engage in unexpected actions (e.g., putting a diaper on one's head), and enthusiastically respond to the child's humorous attempts.
*   **Costs**: Caregiver time for playful engagement and encouragement.

**3. Preschool Years (3-5 years)**
*   **Goals**: Develop understanding of literal incongruities and enjoy repetitive, absurd humor; begin to learn boundaries.
*   **Resources**: Silly books, cartoons, and opportunities for imaginative play.
*   **Strategies**: Introduce exaggerated scenarios (e.g., a dog that meows), engage in call-and-response humor, and gently guide children on appropriate times and places for certain jokes like bathroom humor.
*   **Costs**: Moderate, requiring caregiver creativity and consistent modeling of appropriate humor.

**4. Early Elementary Years (5-8 years)**
*   **Goals**: Cultivate active humor creation, including simple joke-telling and wordplay; enhance understanding of non-literal humor.
*   **Resources**: Joke books, comics, age-appropriate comedy shows, and peers.
*   **Strategies**: Encourage children to learn and tell jokes, play with language, and provide a supportive environment for practicing humor. Expose them to different types of humor.
*   **Costs**: Social learning effort, continued engagement from parents, and cognitive effort to grasp new humor forms.

**5. Late Elementary to Adolescence (9-18 years)**
*   **Goals**: Develop sophisticated humor comprehension (sarcasm, irony, teasing); use humor for social connection and coping.
*   **Resources**: Peer groups, diverse media, and real-life social interactions.
*   **Strategies**: Engage in discussions about social rules of humor, differentiate between playful and hurtful teasing, and encourage the use of humor as a coping mechanism for stress. Observe how funny people use timing and delivery.
*   **Costs**: Emotional investment in navigating social nuances and potential misinterpretations; learning from mistakes in social settings.

**6. Adulthood (18+ years)**
*   **Goals**: Refine a personalized humor style; effectively use humor for leadership, relationship building, stress reduction, and personal well-being.
*   **Resources**: Diverse social networks, cultural experiences, various forms of media (comedians, humorous literature), and self-reflection.
*   **Strategies**: Practice self-deprecating humor and learn to laugh at oneself. Cultivate a playful and positive attitude. Deliberately look for irony and appreciate surprise in everyday life. Immerse oneself in humor by watching comedians and funny content. Reflect on humorous experiences. Engage in humor training or workshops if desired.
*   **Costs**: Continuous effort in self-awareness, emotional management, and adapting humor to varied social and professional contexts.

### Security Vulnerabilities, Attack Methods, Prevention Strategies, and Emergency Measures Related to Sense of Humor

While a sense of humor is largely beneficial, it can, paradoxically, introduce certain security vulnerabilities and be leveraged in malicious ways, particularly through social engineering.

**Security Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Exploitation of Trust**: Humor can quickly build rapport and trust, which can be exploited by malicious actors to lower a target's guard. This increased trust makes individuals more susceptible to manipulation.
2.  **Overconfidence**: A good sense of humor might lead some individuals to believe they are adept at spotting threats, potentially leading to overconfidence and reduced vigilance.
3.  **Human Emotion Exploitation**: Cybercriminals can leverage human emotions, including the desire to laugh or be amused, to trick people into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security.
4.  **Cultural Tendencies**: In some cultures, there may be a tendency to trust others more readily, which can be exploited when humor is used as a social engineering tactic.

**Attack Methods (Social Engineering):**
1.  **Phishing Attacks**: Humor might be embedded in phishing emails or messages to make them seem more legitimate or less threatening, encouraging recipients to click malicious links or download infected attachments.
2.  **Scams**: Humorous scenarios or anecdotes can be used in scams to distract targets or make deceptive requests seem innocuous.
3.  **Baiting**: Attackers might use a "funny" or intriguing premise to entice victims to download malware or access compromised systems.
4.  **Pretexting**: Using a fabricated scenario, often with a humorous or relatable angle, to gain information from a target.
5.  **Quid Pro Quo**: Offering something seemingly funny or entertaining in exchange for information or access.

**Prevention Strategies:**
1.  **Enhanced Awareness and Education**: Users need to be educated on the risks of social engineering, including how humor can be used as a deceptive tool. Training should highlight that even seemingly innocuous humorous interactions can be part of a larger attack.
2.  **Skepticism and Verification**: Foster a culture of skepticism, where employees are encouraged to question unusual requests, even if delivered with humor, and verify information through official channels.
3.  **Robust Security Practices**: Implement strong technical security measures such as multi-factor authentication, robust firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular software updates.
4.  **Clear Policies on Information Sharing**: Establish clear guidelines on what information should never be shared, regardless of the context or apparent harmlessness of a humorous request.
5.  **Regular Security Training**: Conduct ongoing cybersecurity training that includes examples of humor-based social engineering to keep employees updated on evolving threats.

**Emergency Measures:**
1.  **Incident Response Plan**: Organizations must have a well-defined incident response plan to quickly mitigate damage, notify affected parties, and restore systems and data in case of a humor-enabled breach.
2.  **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate compromised systems or accounts immediately upon detecting a suspicious activity that may have originated from a social engineering attack.
3.  **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct thorough forensic analysis to determine the scope of the breach, the methods used, and to identify any further vulnerabilities.
4.  **Communication and Disclosure**: Transparently communicate the incident to relevant stakeholders (e.g., affected users, authorities) as required by regulations and best practices.
5.  **Policy Review and Enhancement**: Post-incident, review and enhance existing security policies and training programs to address the specific vulnerabilities exploited, including those involving humor.

It is crucial to strike a balance: while humor can reduce stress and make cybersecurity more approachable, it should never replace the necessary vigilance and protective practices.

### Phase-Based Challenges and Corresponding Countermeasures in Sense of Humor Development

The development of a sense of humor is not without its challenges, which vary significantly across different life stages, necessitating tailored countermeasures.

**1. Infancy and Toddlerhood (Birth to ~3 years)**
*   **Challenges**: Limited cognitive and language skills mean humor is mostly physical and often repetitive, which might not be engaging for adults. The child's humor might not always be "funny" to others.
*   **Countermeasures**: Caregivers should prioritize physical and sensory play, like tickling and making funny faces, and respond enthusiastically to a child's attempts at humor, even if simple. Authenticity in laughter and sharing enjoyment, even if the humor isn't personally found hilarious, fosters the child's development.

**2. Preschool Years (3-5 years)**
*   **Challenges**: Children interpret humor literally, often leading to a focus on "potty humor" or other socially less accepted forms. There's a risk of misinterpreting social cues or lacking understanding of when certain jokes are inappropriate.
*   **Countermeasures**: Introduce absurd but clean humor and exaggerated scenarios to broaden their understanding of incongruity. Gently set boundaries on humor, explaining *why* certain jokes are inappropriate or belong only in specific contexts (e.g., at home vs. in class). Model age-appropriate humor consistently.

**3. Early Elementary (5-8 years)**
*   **Challenges**: Children may struggle with the timing and delivery of jokes, and their attempts might not always land well with their audience. They might repeat the same jokes incessantly, which can become tiresome.
*   **Countermeasures**: Encourage practice in joke-telling and wordplay in supportive environments. Provide constructive feedback on delivery and timing without discouraging the child. Expose them to diverse humorous content (books, shows) to expand their repertoire and understanding of different comedic styles.

**4. Late Elementary to Adolescence (9-18 years)**
*   **Challenges**: Navigating complex social dynamics and understanding subtle forms of humor like sarcasm and teasing can be difficult. There's an increased risk of using or encountering aggressive or hurtful humor, especially peer-to-peer teasing. Societal expectations about what is "appropriate" humor begin to strongly influence comedic taste, and this can lead to generational mismatches.
*   **Countermeasures**: Foster discussions about the social impact of humor and the fine line between playful teasing and harmful remarks. Emphasize empathy and the importance of not making fun of others' unchangeable traits. Model respectful and inclusive humor, and intervene if offensive jokes are used. Encourage the use of humor as a coping mechanism for stress rather than a weapon.

**5. Adulthood (18+ years)**
*   **Challenges**: The complexity of social and professional settings requires careful judgment in humor use. The risk of offending diverse audiences or being perceived as unprofessional is higher, especially with changing social sensitivities. Some adults may become timid in using humor due to fear of political incorrectness.
*   **Countermeasures**: Cultivate emotional intelligence and self-awareness to read audiences and adapt humor accordingly. Prioritize self-deprecating humor and humor that builds connection rather than alienates. Understand that humor is a skill requiring continuous practice and a willingness to take calculated risks. Emphasize humor's role in stress relief and building positive relationships to overcome timidity.

Across all phases, the principle of not forcing humor and allowing it to be natural is a key countermeasure to many challenges.

### Principles, Rules, Recommendations, and Best Practices for Sense of Humor

A well-developed sense of humor is governed by foundational principles, operational rules, actionable recommendations, and strategic best practices, ensuring its effective and positive application.

**Principles of Sense of Humor:**
1.  **Authenticity and Genuineness**: Humor is most effective when it comes from a genuine place, reflecting what the individual truly finds funny rather than being forced or contrived.
2.  **Emotional State**: A positive and confident emotional state enhances one's ability to be humorous, as it reduces overthinking and allows for more natural, spontaneous ideas.
3.  **Creativity and Surprise**: The essence of good humor often lies in spontaneous creativity, introducing unexpected elements or disproportionate relationships between things to create amusement.
4.  **Playfulness**: A playful attitude is core to humor, involving a willingness to be silly and find joy even in challenging situations.
5.  **Inclusivity**: Humor should ideally bring people together and foster connections, rather than creating divisions or discomfort.

**Rules for Using Humor:**
1.  **Know Your Audience**: Humor must be tailored to the specific audience, considering their cultural background, sensitivities, and the context of the situation.
2.  **Avoid Offense**: Do not use humor that is racist, sexist, crude, or targets a person's religion, political beliefs, or unchangeable traits. If a joke could make someone feel like "the butt of a joke," it should be avoided.
3.  **No Forcing**: Humor should not be forced; trying too hard can lead to awkwardness or make the humor fall flat.
4.  **Be Mindful of Impact**: Consider the potential broader implications of humor, especially in professional settings, and understand that "it was just a joke" is not a valid defense for harmful comments.
5.  **Timing is Crucial**: The effectiveness of humor heavily depends on appropriate timing.

**Recommendations for Improving Sense of Humor:**
1.  **Laugh at Yourself**: This is one of the easiest ways to cultivate good humor, making you appear more confident and approachable.
2.  **Consume Diverse Humor**: Immerse yourself in funny content, such as comedy movies, talk shows, stand-up comedians, and humorous books.

6.  **Surround Yourself with Funny People**: Spend time with individuals who have a good sense of humor, observing and learning from their interactions.
7.  **Maintain Emotional Resilience**: Understand that not all humor attempts will succeed, and be prepared to move on without excessive self-criticism.

**Best Practices for Applying Humor:**
1.  **Build Relationships and Trust**: Use humor as a "social lubricant" to break down barriers, accelerate trust, and strengthen bonds in both personal and professional relationships.
2.  **Reduce Tension and Stress**: Strategically deploy humor to lighten the mood, diffuse conflicts, and provide a much-needed release valve in stressful situations.
3.  **Enhance Leadership and Engagement**: Leaders should use appropriate humor to be more motivating, relatable, and to foster higher employee engagement and better team performance.
4.  **Foster Creativity**: Humor can disrupt preconditioned thought patterns, opening the mind to new possibilities and stimulating creativity.
5.  **Model Appropriate Behavior**: Leaders and individuals should be role models for positive humor, ensuring it aligns with organizational values and promotes an inclusive environment.
