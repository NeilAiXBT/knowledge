you must give all explanaintions and examples for all words

Sat Jul 12 2025

Apologies, I did not provide the full explanations and examples for every word in the previous response. Here is a comprehensive list of English prepositions, with clear and brief explanations and examples for each, designed to be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE).

English prepositions are words that connect nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other elements within a sentence, indicating relationships of direction, location, time, or other abstract connections. They function as "connector words" that link various parts of a sentence, making its meaning clear. For instance, "I went *to* the store" shows "to" connecting the location "store" to the action of going. There are approximately 150 prepositions in English, and three of the most commonly used words—"of," "to," and "in"—are prepositions. Prepositions are considered a 'closed class' of words, meaning new words are rarely added to this group over time.

### Categories of English Prepositions

Prepositions are generally categorized by their structure, encompassing single-word forms, multi-word phrases, and even certain verbal forms that function as prepositions.
