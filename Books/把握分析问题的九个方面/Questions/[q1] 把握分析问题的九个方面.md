Here are 120 crucial basic questions and answers regarding problem analysis, designed to help you get smart faster.

1.  **What is the fundamental importance of defining a problem accurately?**
    Accurately defining a problem is the foundation for solving it effectively. It simplifies and clarifies the issue, helping to determine its importance.

2.  **What is a "crisis" in the context of problem analysis?**
    A crisis is generally defined as an urgent, unexpected problem that causes significant or potentially significant damage to people, organizations, or other resources. It represents a critical turning point.

3.  **What is the "suddenness" characteristic of a crisis problem?**
    Suddenness means that the timing, location, manner, and extent of a crisis's eruption are unexpected and difficult to predict. It highlights the accidental and random nature of crises.

4.  **Can you give an example of the suddenness of a crisis?**
    Natural disasters like earthquakes and floods are examples where the eruption is unforeseen. Another is the Tylenol capsule poisoning incident, which occurred without any prior warning.

5.  **What does the "urgency" of a crisis problem imply?**
    Urgency means that once a crisis erupts, its destructive energy is quickly released and spreads rapidly, often leading to a loss of control if not addressed promptly. The time available for response, analysis, and handling is extremely limited.

6.  **Provide an example illustrating the urgency of a crisis.**
    Incidents like plane crashes, stadium riots, or car accidents occur in a very short timeframe, demanding immediate action. For instance, a car accident often happens within 1-2 seconds.

7.  **What is the "harmfulness" characteristic of a crisis problem?**
    Harmfulness refers to the direct and indirect damages a crisis inflicts upon personnel, organizations, and resources. The more severe the crisis, the greater its scope of harm and destructive power, leading to more tragic losses.

8.  **What types of damage can a crisis's harmfulness include?**
    Damage can include casualties, organizational collapse, property loss, environmental destruction, and destructive impacts on societal and individual psychology, permeating all aspects of social life.

9.  **Can you give an example of a crisis's harmfulness?**
    The "9/11" terrorist attacks in the US caused direct losses like aircraft destruction, building collapse, and casualties. Indirectly, it devastated many industries, with the aviation sector alone losing $10 billion and nearly 100,000 jobs.

10. **What is the "contagion" or "transmission" characteristic of a crisis problem?**
    Contagion means that one crisis often triggers the occurrence of another. An already erupted crisis is both a "result of a cause" and a "cause of a result," creating a ripple effect.

11. **Illustrate the contagion of a crisis with an example.**
    The "9/11" attacks not only caused severe losses in the US aviation industry but also impacted finance, insurance, media, and tourism sectors. It also elevated national panic and led to further crisis issues like the Afghanistan military strike.

12. **What is the "opportunistic" characteristic of a crisis problem?**
    Opportunism suggests that despite being difficult to avoid, some crises harbor opportunities. The Chinese word "危机" (wēijī) itself combines "danger" (危) and "opportunity" (机).

13. **How can a crisis be seen as an opportunity?**
    A crisis can be a turning point, potentially leading to a better outcome. It contains both roots of failure and seeds of success. The essence of crisis management lies in discovering, nurturing, and harvesting these potential opportunities.

14. **What is an "analysis outline" or "framework"?**
    An analysis outline is a structured approach or plan specially designed by an analyst to solve a problem. It helps to define what needs to be analyzed and sets initial criteria for decision-making.

15. **Why is it important to understand your own analysis outline?**
    Understanding your analysis outline allows for better analysis and clearer recognition of necessary changes when the analysis needs to be modified. It helps you focus on the crucial aspects of a problem.

16. **What is a "winning outline"?**
    A "winning outline" is the correct way to consider a problem, focusing attention on its important aspects while giving appropriate consideration to other related facets. It leads to wise choices.

17. **What are the three main things to consider to understand your own analysis outline?**
    To understand your outline, first consider: (1) the scope you set for the problem, (2) the reference points you use to define success or failure, and (3) the criteria you use for evaluation and comparison.

18. **What are "analogies" (引喻) in the context of problem analysis?**
    Analogies are comparisons or metaphors that play a significant role in many people's problem outlines. Good analysts carefully select analogies to highlight important aspects of a situation.

19. **How do analogies help in understanding problems?**
    When used wisely, analogies help us understand a current, complex situation by relating it to something we already understand more clearly, often drawing from our personal or professional experience.

20. **What are the four main factors of an "excellent analysis process"?**
    The four main factors are: (1) Outline, (2) Information Gathering, (3) Drawing Conclusions, and (4) Learning from Feedback (or failing to learn).

21. **What is the "Outline" factor in the excellent analysis process?**
    The outline forms the skeleton of the problem, defining what must be analyzed and setting initial criteria that favor certain choices over others. It involves simplifying the problem.

22. **What does "Information Gathering" involve in the analysis process?**
    Information gathering involves finding known facts needed for decision-making and making reasonable estimates for "unknowns." It requires caution to avoid overconfidence or biases.

23. **What is the purpose of "Drawing Conclusions" in the analysis process?**
    Drawing conclusions means processing gathered information and insights to arrive at judgments or solutions. A systematic approach often leads to better analyses than merely relying on intuition.

24. **Why is a systematic approach better for drawing conclusions than intuition alone?**
    Systematic approaches force you to examine many aspects, often leading to more accurate judgments, even for experts, compared to relying solely on intuitive judgments.

25. **What does "Learning from Feedback" entail in the analysis process?**
    Learning from feedback means establishing a system to continuously track expected outcomes, prevent self-serving interpretations, and integrate lessons learned into future similar analyses.

26. **Are these four factors of analysis always sequential?**
    No, they are not always sequential. For example, information discovered during "information gathering" can often lead you back to reframe your "outline."

27. **What is "Metaphysical Analysis" (形而上分析) in problem solving?**
    Metaphysical analysis refers to the initial, thoughtful choices you make about the analysis process itself, which can significantly impact the overall effort. It involves asking foundational questions about the problem.

28. **What is the benefit of performing metaphysical analysis?**
    It helps avoid the common analytical trap of "rushing in" (贸然投入) without proper thought. It helps you make appropriate judgments on what aspects are most critical and how to allocate time and resources.

29. **What is a common pitfall analysts face related to metaphysical analysis?**
    Many analysts find it difficult to focus on metaphysical analysis and often fall into the trap of rushing directly into the analysis process without sufficient preliminary thought.

30. **What does "understanding your own framework" mean in problem analysis?**
    It means understanding how you simplify your problem and how you define its boundaries. This awareness allows you to make a more proper analysis.

31. **What is the concept of "Positive Part" (正部) and "Negative Part" (负部) of a problem?**
    From the perspective of problem duality, any problem has two opposing aspects. The "positive part" refers to aspects that contribute positively to a certain feature's value, while the "negative part" contributes negatively.

32. **Can something be a "negative part" but still "beneficial"?**
    Yes. For example, wastewater treatment in a company is a "negative part" regarding profit (as it costs money), but it is "beneficial" as it prevents environmental pollution and improves the company's image.

33. **What is the "One Stone, Multiple Birds" (一举多得) or "Multi-purpose" idea in problem analysis?**
    This idea suggests that a single action or solution can often lead to multiple beneficial outcomes, maximizing efficiency and impact. Applying this thought can yield twice the results with half the effort.

34. **How does creative thinking relate to problem analysis?**
    Creative thinking is the soul of analysis, permeating the entire process. The essence of analysis is innovation and seeking change, ensuring solutions are fresh and effective.

35. **What is a "great analysis" (杰出的分析)?**
    A great analysis is defined as "outstanding creativity + the highest possible expected outcome." It emphasizes the importance of innovative thought.

36. **What is the importance of having clear goals in problem analysis?**
    Clear goals generate conviction and are a necessary prerequisite for solving problems and achieving desired results. They also serve as the basic criteria for evaluating solutions and outcomes.

37. **What happens if goals are unclear?**
    If goals are unclear or ambiguous, it becomes difficult to succeed and to evaluate the quality of the analysis or the effectiveness of the solutions.

38. **What are "tangible parts" (实部) and "intangible parts" (虚部) of a problem?**
    Tangible parts are the material components of a problem, while intangible parts are the non-material components. For example, a house's walls are tangible, but the space within is intangible.

39. **Why is it important to consider both tangible and intangible parts in analysis?**
    Effective analysis requires attention to both. Tangible parts form the basis, while intangible parts allow for utilization and value. A combination of both makes a complete entity.

40. **Can you provide an example of tangible and intangible parts for a business?**
    For a business, capital, equipment, factories, products, and personnel are its tangible parts. Corporate image, brand awareness, technical proficiency, and management level are its intangible parts.

41. **What are "hard parts" (硬部) and "soft parts" (软部) in a system-based view of a problem?**
    Hard parts refer to the entirety of a problem's components. Soft parts refer to the relationships between a problem's components and its relationships with other problems.

42. **Why is studying soft parts crucial in problem analysis?**
    Studying only the components (hard parts) is insufficient. One must also deeply investigate their internal and external relationships. A machine might not work even if all parts are fine, simply due to a loose connection (soft part).

43. **What are the three types of relationships that form the "soft parts" of a problem?**
    The soft parts consist of: (1) internal relationships between components, (2) external relationships with the larger problem it belongs to, and (3) external connections with other unrelated problems.

44. **What does the phrase "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" (整体大于部分之和) imply in problem analysis?**
    It emphasizes that the soft parts (relationships and interactions) are crucial. The combined effect of components working together can be more significant than their individual contributions.

45. **Why is simplifying problems important for analysis?**
    Simplifying problems helps to focus on the key issues, making it easier to identify core causes and effective solutions without getting overwhelmed by complexity.

46. **What does it mean to "put good steel on the blade" (好钢用在刀刃上) in problem-solving?**
    It means identifying the critical issues and focusing resources and effort on them to achieve the maximum impact, rather than spreading effort thinly.

47. **How does the concept of "turning point" relate to crisis?**
    A crisis is often defined as a "turning point" where a situation can become either better or worse, implying a decisive moment where outcomes hang in the balance.

48. **What is the common perception of crisis among researchers?**
    Many researchers define crisis from different angles, but generally agree it signifies a severe difficulty or a dangerous, urgent state caused by unexpected problems.

49. **According to Ian I. Mitroff, what is a guiding definition of crisis?**
    Mitroff suggests a crisis is "a problem that can or has the potential to impact the entire organization." He emphasizes managing crisis over strictly defining it.

50. **What did T.H. Kuhn consider a crisis to be?**
    Kuhn viewed crisis as a phase of "transition from normal science to scientific revolution, from an old paradigm to a new one," occurring when anomalies accumulate and threaten the existing paradigm.

51. **How did Barton define crisis?**
    Barton defined a crisis as "an uncertain problem with potential negative impact, which, along with its consequences, can cause tremendous damage to an organization, its employees, products, services, assets, and reputation."

52. **What common elements did Rosenthal and Pijnenburg identify in their definition of crisis?**
    They both agreed that a crisis is a situation characterized by "severe threat, uncertainty, and urgency."

53. **What three scenarios did Robert Heath associate with crisis?**
    Heath identified crisis as encompassing: (1) threats to personnel and resources, (2) loss of control, and (3) visible and invisible impacts on personnel, organizations, and resources.

54. **How did Steven Fink define crisis?**
    Fink defined crisis as "an unstable period or state where a decisive change is about to occur."

55. **How do people perceive the "suddenness" of a crisis?**
    People perceive suddenness in three ways: (1) crises are triggered by uncontrollable objective factors (e.g., natural disasters), (2) they erupt in people's blind spots (e.g., unexpected poisoning), or (3) they result from overlooked details or concealed dangers.

56. **What is an example of a crisis stemming from "overlooked details"?**
    A company deliberately concealed for 15 years that its silicone breast implants could rupture or leak, leading to a crisis and bankruptcy when the truth was exposed.

57. **How does information technology affect the "urgency" of a crisis?**
    Rapidly developing information technology greatly shortens time and space, meaning even small mistakes can quickly escalate into major incidents.

58. **What is the impact of a severe crisis's harmfulness?**
    The more severe the crisis, the broader its scope of harm and destructive power, leading to more tragic losses across various aspects of social life, beyond just physical damage.

59. **Why is identifying key problems essential in problem analysis?**
    It's about "putting good steel on the blade," meaning focusing efforts on the most critical issues that will yield the most significant results.

60. **What does it mean for problems to have "extendability" (可拓性)?**
    It implies that a single event or object can have many features, and a single feature can be possessed by many events or objects. Problems are interconnected and can extend into various aspects.

61. **What is "common interest" (共趣性) in problems?**
    It refers to a shared interest or connection between different problems, allowing for a more integrated approach to analysis.

62. **What kind of thinking should an analyst possess when analyzing problems?**
    An analyst should possess "multi-purpose" (一举多得) thinking and creative thinking.

63. **What is the underlying philosophy of "one object, multiple uses" or "one arrow, two eagles"?**
    These phrases embody the "one stone, multiple birds" philosophy, aiming for multiple favorable outcomes from a single action.

64. **What is the role of creative thinking in analysis?**
    Creative thinking is the "soul" of analysis, leading to innovation and change. Without it, analysis can become rigid and dogmatic.

65. **Is creative thinking arbitrary?**
    No, creative thinking is not wild and unconstrained; it follows certain patterns and principles. It requires a deep understanding of the problem's essence and internal connections.

66. **What is the meaning of the proverb: "For a ship sailing aimlessly, any wind is a headwind"?**
    It emphasizes the critical importance of having clear goals. Without a clear destination, no effort can be truly effective.

67. **How does clear goal setting impact problem analysis?**
    Clear goals provide a basis for action, generate firm conviction, and serve as the necessary prerequisite for achieving results and evaluating solutions.

68. **What is the "expected value" (期望值) in the context of analysis goals?**
    The expected value is the desired outcome or result when an analysis leads to implementation. It's the benchmark against which the success of the analysis is judged.

69. **How can you assess the quality of an analysis?**
    The quality of an analysis is usually determined by its results, which are then evaluated by comparing them against the predefined target values or goals.

70. **Why is it challenging for most analysts to engage in metaphysical analysis?**
    They tend to fall into the trap of rushing into the analysis process without first taking the time to consider the fundamental aspects and potential pitfalls.

71. **What does Michael Porter's framework for corporate competition highlight?**
    Porter's framework helps businesses understand competition not just from direct rivals, but also from suppliers (who might overcharge), customers (who want to pay less), substitute products, potential new entrants, and even government or employees.

72. **What is meant by "revising the outline" when necessary?**
    It means that analysts should be prepared to adjust their problem-solving framework if their initial understanding of the problem or its context proves incomplete or incorrect.

73. **Why are "soft parts" crucial even if "hard parts" seem okay?**
    A system might fail even if all its individual "hard parts" are functional if the "soft parts" (connections, relationships) are faulty, like a broken wire preventing a machine from working.

74. **What does the example of "one monk carries water, two monks carry water, three monks have no water" illustrate?**
    It illustrates the importance of "soft parts"—how individuals or components interact and organize affects overall outcomes, even with the same resources (three people).

75. **What is the difference between "positive/negative" and "advantageous/disadvantageous"?**
    "Positive/negative" refers to a value's numerical sign regarding a feature (e.g., profit). "Advantageous/disadvantageous" refers to the overall benefit or harm. A negative part (cost) can be advantageous (e.g., environmental protection).

76. **How does the case of the Japanese pilot landing in the bay illustrate a flawed analysis framework?**
    The pilot tried to frame his error as a small percentage of his total flight distance, rather than the absolute fact of mislanding. This highlights thinking in percentages instead of absolute values.

77. **What is the lesson from the story of Florence Chadwick, the swimmer?**
    She failed to cross the Catalina Channel due to thick fog obscuring her target, illustrating that fatigue or cold were not the primary deterrent, but rather the lack of a clear, visible goal.

78. **What is the meaning of "analysis is the starting point of everything" (分析是一切事情的起点)?**
    It means that the initial analysis determines the direction and ultimately the success of any problem-solving endeavor.

79. **What is the relationship between judgment and analysis?**
    Judgment is the basis of decision-making, and analysis is the basis of judgment. Effective decisions stem from sound judgments, which in turn rely on thorough analysis.

80. **What is a "contradiction problem" (矛盾问题)?**
    Human history is often framed as a process of solving various contradiction problems, from primitive societies to modern times, implying challenges arising from opposing forces or ideas.

81. **What are "types of problems" that humans have solved throughout history?**
    Humans have solved various "contradiction problems" and have progressed through stages of relating to nature: submitting to it, fighting against it, and now, entering an era of intelligently managing and harmonizing with it.

82. **Why is it important to simplify a problem?**
    Simplification helps to make the problem clearer and easier to understand, preventing analysts from being overwhelmed by unnecessary details.

83. **What is the role of an analyst in "simplifying everything"?**
    Good analysts inevitably simplify everything when constructing their outline, deciding what is important and what is not.

84. **What is a "reference point" in problem analysis?**
    A reference point is a benchmark or standard used to define whether an outcome is considered a success or a failure.

85. **What are "comparison criteria" (评估比较用的标准)?**
    These are the standards or metrics used to evaluate and compare different options or outcomes in problem analysis.

86. **What is the "deeper outline" or "underlying analogy" in one's thinking?**
    These are the implicit comparisons or frameworks (e.g., seeing business as a football game or a war) that unconsciously influence how one analyzes situations.

87. **Where do these deeper analytical concepts come from?**
    They often stem from one's culture, profession, education, and family background.

88. **Why should analysts re-examine their analyses through "other outlines" before making a final decision?**
    This helps to provide a fresh perspective and ensure that no crucial aspects are missed due to a limited initial framework.

89. **Is structured analysis more effortful than unstructured analysis?**
    In the long run, a well-trained, systematic analytical approach is less effortful than an untrained one, despite seeming complex initially.

90. **What is the primary task of a senior manager regarding analysis frameworks?**

91. **What is a "good analyst" like, similar to a good athlete?**
    A good analyst systematically examines the analysis process, understands how each part contributes to excellence, and continuously works to eliminate errors.

92. **How does overconfidence impact information gathering?**
    Overconfidence can lead to failure, as analysts might believe they know more than they do, preventing them from gathering adequate information or acknowledging "unknowns."

93. **What did Will Rogers mean by "It's not what we don't know that gets us into trouble. It's what we know for sure that just ain't so"?**
    He highlighted the danger of confidently holding onto incorrect information or assumptions, which can be more detrimental than actual lack of knowledge.

94. **What is the purpose of a "systematic approach" when drawing conclusions?**
    A systematic approach forces an analyst to review many aspects, often leading to better analyses compared to haphazard thinking.

95. **How does learning from feedback create a "system"?**
    It requires establishing a mechanism for continuous tracking of expected results, preventing self-serving interpretations of outcomes, and actively applying lessons learned to future analyses.

96. **Why is it important to distinguish between different "development stages" of analysis?**
    Unless an analyst clearly knows which part of the analysis process they are in at any given moment, they might struggle to identify where specific errors occurred.

97. **What is the benefit of understanding the stages and pitfalls of analysis?**
    Once you understand the stages and potential pitfalls, it becomes much easier to prevent mistakes.

98. **What does it mean to "be responsible for the problem" (对问题要负责任)?**
    It implies taking ownership of the problem and its analysis, not just identifying it but also working towards a resolution.

99. **Why is "harmony" (以和为贵) important in problem-solving?**
    It suggests that sometimes, the best way to handle a problem is to minimize conflict and seek amicable solutions, recognizing that not every issue needs to be a confrontational "problem."

100. **What does "leaving room for others" (给别人留余地) mean in problem-solving?**
    It means being considerate and flexible in negotiations or solutions, as it ultimately provides convenience for oneself.
