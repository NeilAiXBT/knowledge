The 5-Why method is a powerful iterative interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem, aiming to uncover its root cause. By repeatedly asking "Why?", typically five times, one can delve beyond superficial symptoms to identify the fundamental issues. This systematic approach ensures that problem-solving efforts are directed at the actual source of the problem, rather than merely addressing its visible effects.

Applying the 5-Why method effectively involves understanding the problem's scope and complexity, which can be categorized into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. Basic problems are often straightforward with direct causes, while intermediate issues involve processes or minor system interactions. Advanced problems are typically complex, systemic, and may involve multiple interacting factors, requiring a deeper organizational or strategic analysis to identify underlying drivers.

Here are examples of 5-Why Q&As categorized by their complexity level, illustrating how the method helps in thorough problem identification and resolution.
