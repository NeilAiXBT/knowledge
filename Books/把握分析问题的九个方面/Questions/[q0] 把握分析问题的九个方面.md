Here are the Q&As on problem analysis:

## Basic Level Q&As

1.  **Q: What is the fundamental step in problem-solving?**
    A: The fundamental step in problem-solving is accurately defining the problem. This means simplifying and clarifying it to determine its importance.

2.  **Q: How is a "crisis" generally understood?**
    A: A "crisis" is commonly understood as a critical juncture of severe difficulty, or a dangerous and urgent situation caused by unexpected problems. It's a turning point that can lead to better or worse outcomes.

3.  **Q: What is the primary characteristic of crisis problems?**
    A: The primary characteristic of crisis problems is their suddenness or "突发性" (Tūfāxìng). This means they occur unexpectedly, without prior warning, making them difficult to predict or control, like a sudden earthquake.

4.  **Q: What does the "urgency" of a crisis problem imply?**
    A: The "urgency" (紧急性) of a crisis problem means that once it erupts, it rapidly releases destructive energy and spreads quickly, leaving very limited time for people to react, analyze, and handle it. For example, a car accident happens within 1-2 seconds.

5.  **Q: What does the "harmfulness" of a crisis problem refer to?**
    A: The "harmfulness" (危害性) of a crisis problem indicates that it can cause various direct and indirect damages to people, organizations, and resources. The more severe the crisis, the greater the harm and destruction, impacting not just physical assets but also social and individual psychology.

6.  **Q: What does the "transmissibility" of a crisis problem suggest?**
    A: The "transmissibility" (传导性) of a crisis problem means that one crisis often leads to the occurrence of another. It's like a ripple effect: an initial small crisis can trigger a series of larger related problems. For instance, the 9/11 attacks had a severe impact on various industries beyond aviation.

7.  **Q: Can a crisis also present opportunities?**
    A: Yes, a crisis can also present opportunities. The Chinese word for "crisis" (危机) itself contains both "danger" (危) and "opportunity" (机). Every crisis holds seeds of success, and the essence of crisis management lies in discovering and cultivating these potential opportunities.

8.  **Q: What are the three stages of human interaction with nature in history?**
    A: In human history, the relationship between humans and nature can be divided into three stages:
    1.  Submitting to nature.
    2.  Struggling against nature.
    3.  Entering an era of intellectual control, harmoniously coexisting with nature through scientific and technological development.

9.  **Q: What is the concept of "positive and negative parts" in problem analysis?**
    A: In problem analysis, "positive and negative parts" refer to the opposing aspects of a problem. A problem's overall characteristic is a combination of its positive-value parts (positive part) and negative-value parts (negative part) concerning that characteristic. For example, wastewater treatment is a negative part for profit, but it prevents environmental harm.

10. **Q: What is the "one stone, two birds" (一箭双雕) thinking in problem analysis?**
    A: This refers to the idea of achieving multiple beneficial outcomes from a single action or solution. It emphasizes efficiency, where addressing one aspect of a problem simultaneously resolves or improves several related issues, achieving a "win-win" situation.

11. **Q: What is the primary goal of defining a problem clearly?**
    A: The primary goal of defining a problem clearly is to make it simpler and more explicit, enabling a judgment of its importance. For clients, accurately defining the problem is a key to successful analysis.

12. **Q: What is the purpose of categorizing crisis problems?**
    A: The purpose of categorizing crisis problems is to gain a clear understanding of potential crisis types, learn their distinct characteristics, and proactively adopt different strategies and methods to respond to them.

13. **Q: What is the meaning of "crisis management"?**
    A: Crisis management is a process that involves crisis early warning, prevention, and handling, aiming to avoid or reduce the harm and losses caused by a crisis, and to seize development opportunities from it.

14. **Q: Why is communication ability important in problem analysis?**
    A: Communication ability is crucial in problem analysis because it helps to clarify the various relationships involved with the problem. Without effective communication, it becomes difficult to understand and address the problem comprehensively.

## Intermediate Level Q&As

1.  **Q: How do researchers define "crisis"?**
    A: Researchers define "crisis" from various perspectives:
    *   **Webster:** A turning point for better or worse, a decisive moment, or a situation reaching a critical stage.
    *   **Ian I. Mitroff:** A guiding definition is "a problem that can or has the potential to affect the entire organization."
    *   **T.H. Kuhn:** A stage of transition from normal science to scientific revolution, from an old paradigm to a new one, occurring when anomalies accumulate and paradigm adjustment repeatedly fails.
    *   **Barton:** An uncertain problem with potential negative impacts that can cause significant damage to an organization, its employees, products, services, assets, and reputation.
    *   **Rosenthal & Pijnenburg:** A situation characterized by severe threat, uncertainty, and urgency.
    *   **Robert Heath:** Encompasses threats to people and resources, loss of control, and visible/invisible impacts on people, organizations, and resources.
    *   **Steven Fink:** An unstable period or state when a problem is about to undergo a decisive change.

2.  **Q: What is the comprehensive basic meaning of a crisis based on various definitions?**
    A: Synthesizing various definitions, a crisis fundamentally means "various urgent, unexpected problems that cause or have the potential to cause significant harm to people, organizations, and other resources."

3.  **Q: Provide examples illustrating the "suddenness" of crisis problems.**
    A: The suddenness manifests in three ways:
    *   **Uncontrollable objective factors:** Like sudden natural disasters (earthquakes, floods).
    *   **Blind spots in perception:** Such as the Tylenol capsule poisoning incident where no warning existed.
    *   **Neglected details or concealed dangers:** For example, a company concealing the risks of its breast implants for 15 years, leading to bankruptcy when exposed.

4.  **Q: How does modern information technology affect the "urgency" of a crisis?**
    A: Modern information technology, by greatly shortening time and space, amplifies the urgency of a crisis. Even minor errors can quickly escalate into major incidents, as exemplified by a drug being pulled from shelves overnight due to an ingredient issue, causing rapid market collapse.

5.  **Q: Provide an example illustrating the "harmfulness" of a crisis.**
    A: The 9/11 terrorist attacks directly caused loss of planes, building collapses, and casualties. Indirectly, they devastated many U.S. industries (e.g., aviation losses of $10 billion, nearly 100,000 layoffs) and lowered global economic growth by one percentage point, incurring $350 billion in losses.

6.  **Q: How can a crisis be a "watershed"?**
    A: A crisis acts as a watershed, meaning it can either lead to a worse situation or a better one. It contains both the roots of failure and the seeds of success. Effective crisis management aims to leverage the situation for positive transformation.

7.  **Q: What does it mean for a problem to have "extensibility" (可拓性)?**
    A: Problem extensibility implies that a single event or object can possess many characteristics, and one characteristic can be shared by many events or objects. This suggests that solving one problem can pave the way for other related tasks or trigger associated events.

8.  **Q: What is the concept of "mutual benefit" (互利性) in problem-solving?**
    A: This concept suggests that when analyzing problems, one should aim for solutions that benefit multiple parties. For example, a consulting firm's training session not only promoted its theories to the client but also served as market research for its own studies by interacting with company personnel.

9.  **Q: Why is understanding your "analytical framework" important?**
    A: Having a clear understanding of your analytical framework (分析纲要) is crucial because it leads to better analysis and allows you to recognize necessary changes when your approach needs adjustment. A good framework guides wise decisions by focusing on important aspects of a problem while giving due attention to others.

10. **Q: What elements define your analytical framework?**
    A: To understand your analytical framework, consider:
    1.  The scope you define for the problem.
    2.  The reference points you use to define success or failure.
    3.  The criteria you use for evaluation and comparison.

11. **Q: How can one overcome the fear of failure in problem analysis?**
    A: Overcoming the fear of failure is crucial. Instead of viewing failure as a permanent stain, embrace it as a learning opportunity. Analyze "what went wrong?" and "how can it be done better in the future?" This active learning approach, instead of fault-finding, leads to improvement.

12. **Q: What is the importance of "respecting balanced relationships" (平衡关系) in problem analysis?**
    A: Many problems arise from imbalances in interests (e.g., political, economic, emotional). Therefore, when analyzing a problem, it is crucial to adhere to the principle of balancing interests. This means considering how a solution impacts different stakeholders to prevent further conflict.

## Advanced Level Q&As

1.  **Q: How does the "paradigm shift" concept relate to crisis as described by T.H. Kuhn?**
    A: T.H. Kuhn views crisis as a critical phase in scientific development where accumulated anomalies challenge an existing paradigm. When attempts to reconcile these anomalies within the old framework repeatedly fail, a "crisis" triggers a shift from that established paradigm to a new one, leading to scientific revolution.

2.  **Q: Explain the concept of "perceptual blind spots" (知觉盲区) in crisis eruption.**
    A: Perceptual blind spots refer to situations where a crisis erupts from conditions that people were previously unaware of or had no warning about. The Johnson & Johnson Tylenol case, where capsules were poisoned without prior warning, exemplifies how a crisis can emerge from an entirely unforeseen and undetectable source before the actual incident.

3.  **Q: Provide a detailed example of how concealed dangers can lead to a massive crisis.**
    A: The example of a company intentionally concealing the risks of its silicone breast implants for 15 years demonstrates this. When the truth about potential ruptures and leaks was exposed by media, the company quickly plunged into crisis and had to file for bankruptcy protection, illustrating how long-term hidden issues can suddenly erupt with devastating consequences.

4.  **Q: How does the concept of "reciprocity" (欲取先予) apply in problem-solving and negotiation?**
    A: The principle "give first to receive" (欲取先予) is a strategic approach in problem-solving. It means proactively offering benefits or making concessions to gain a more advantageous and assured position later. The example of the landowner donating land for a university, then profiting from the surrounding commercial development, illustrates how a "giving" action can pave the way for greater "receiving."

5.  **Q: How can understanding the 'negative part' of a problem be beneficial?**
    A: The "negative part" of a problem, while appearing disadvantageous (e.g., wastewater for profit), can also have beneficial aspects. For example, worker welfare departments, though a "negative part" for profit, improve employee morale and corporate image, which are "advantageous" to the company. Analyzing these "negative parts" thoroughly allows for their strategic utilization.

6.  **Q: How does the "auditing your analysis" process contribute to improved problem-solving?**
    A: Auditing your analysis involves critically reviewing past problem-solving attempts, both successful and unsuccessful, to identify what worked and what didn't. This reflective process, like a tennis training camp, helps you learn from mistakes, refine your analytical framework, and develop a more disciplined approach over time, leading to better outcomes.

7.  **Q: Explain the three types of crisis problems based on incompatibility between elements.**
    A: Crisis problems can be broadly categorized by the incompatibility threshold between different elements:
    1.  **Goal and Condition Incompatibility:** Crisis arises when the incompatibility between a goal and its conditions exceeds a threshold. Example: A flood disaster occurs when a river's discharge capacity is less than the flood's flow.
    2.  **Condition and Condition Incompatibility:** Crisis results from conflict between two or more conditions under a shared goal. Example: Interpersonal relationship problems stem from conflicting internal or external conditions among individuals.
    3.  **Goal and Goal Incompatibility:** Crisis is caused by the sharp contradiction between two or more mutually exclusive goals under the same conditions. Example: Terrorist activities arise from goals that conflict with human civilization, or legal disputes where parties' goals conflict.

8.  **Q: What is the role of an "analytical outline" (分析纲要) in complex problem-solving?**
    A: For complex problems, a well-defined analytical outline is essential. It helps you articulate your thought process, ensuring you consider key elements like problem scope, success criteria, and evaluation standards. A clear outline enables a more refined analysis and helps in understanding where adjustments are needed if the initial approach doesn't yield results.

9.  **Q: How can an organization foster a learning environment regarding analytical failures, drawing from the IBM example?**
    A: The IBM story (Watson telling a manager who lost $5,000, "I just spent $5,000 educating you") highlights a culture that views mistakes as learning investments rather than punishable offenses. For organizations to improve problem analysis, they should create an environment where individuals are encouraged to learn from errors, share insights, and collectively refine their analytical processes without fear of severe repercussions.

10. **Q: How does "enriching work" (工作调剂) improve problem-solving effectiveness and creativity?**
    A: "Enriching work" involves diversifying tasks and incorporating areas of personal interest into one's work plan. This prevents monotony and burnout, leading to improved efficiency, increased creativity, and better problem-solving. For instance, breaking down a long meeting into shorter segments with diverse activities maintains energy and focus, even if it seems like a "waste of time" initially.
