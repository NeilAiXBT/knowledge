## Key Points

### 1. The Foundational Role of Problem Analysis
*   **Analysis as a Starting Point:** Analysis is the crucial initial step in any endeavor, determining one's future direction.
*   **Decision Basis:** Problem analysis serves as the foundation for making informed judgments and decisions.
*   **Importance of Definition:** Accurately defining a problem is fundamental to solving it, simplifying and clarifying the issue, and assessing its significance.

### 2. Defining and Classifying Contradictory Problems
*   **History of Contradiction Resolution:** Human history is characterized by the continuous resolution of various contradictions, driving societal progress.
*   **Types of Contradictory Problems:**
    *   **Incompatible Type (不相容型):** Arises from conflicts between subjective desires and objective conditions (e.g., a small scale for a large elephant). Solutions involve transforming the objective (like the elephant into stones) or the goal (like "Besieging Wei to rescue Zhao").
    *   **Oppositional Type (对立型):** Occurs when two or more goals cannot be simultaneously achieved under the same conditions (e.g., a wolf and a chicken in one cage, conflicting traffic rules). Solutions involve creating a "conversion bridge" to enable coexistence.
    *   **Objective Contradictory Problems (客观矛盾问题):** Conflicts inherent in objective issues (e.g., pests affecting plants, desertification). Resolution often requires human intervention to transform them into solvable types.
*   **Paths to Resolve Contradictions:**
    *   **Transform the Goal (变换目标):** Change what you aim to achieve if conditions are rigid.
    *   **Transform the Conditions (变换条件):** Modify the circumstances if the goal is fixed.
    *   **Transform Both (同时变换目标和条件):** Adjust both aspects for complex problems.
*   **Contradictions as Drivers:** Conflicts are not inherently negative; they serve as a powerful impetus for reform, innovation, and human development.

### 3. Understanding the Extensibility of Problems
*   **Inherent Property:** Problems possess "extensibility," meaning they can be expanded, providing multiple transformation paths for solutions.
*   **Aspects of Extensibility:**
    *   **Divergence (发散性):** Problems have multiple characteristics ("one thing, multiple characteristics"; "one characteristic, multiple things/values"), allowing for diverse solution methods.
    *   **Relevance (相关性):** Problems and their characteristics are interconnected; changing one aspect can lead to "conductive transformations" in others (e.g., raising wages impacting productivity and consumption, clothing trends affecting accessory sales).
    *   **Inclusiveness (蕴含性):** The realization of problem A necessarily implies the realization of problem B. This can be strategically used for "anti-acquisition" or achieving complex goals (e.g., Rockefeller's strategy for oil dominance).
    *   **Expandability (可扩性):** Problems can be combined or decomposed into new problems, leading to novel properties (e.g., combining components of a machine, selling product series). This principle underpins multi-functional products and sales strategies.

### 4. Exploring the Conjugacy (共轭性) of Problems
*   **Holistic View:** Problem structure can be analyzed through its material, systemic, dynamic, and oppositional aspects, termed "conjugacy," for a complete understanding.
*   **Conjugate Pairs:**
    *   **Virtual (虚部) and Real (实部):** Problems have tangible (real) and intangible (virtual) components. Analysis must consider both (e.g., a house's physical structure vs. its enclosed space; a company's assets vs. its brand image).
    *   **Soft (软部) and Hard (硬部):** The "hard part" refers to the components of a problem, while the "soft part" refers to the relationships between components and with other problems. Understanding the "soft part" (relationships) is crucial for problem resolution (e.g., "three monks have no water" due to relationship issues).
    *   **Latent (潜部) and Manifest (显部):** Problems have hidden (latent) and apparent (manifest) aspects. Effective problem-solving requires anticipating latent issues (e.g., future electricity demand, potential market shifts).
    *   **Negative (负部) and Positive (正部):** Problems possess opposing facets or values. Analyzing both "negative" and "positive" parts, and distinguishing between "harm" and "benefit," is vital for leveraging them (e.g., treating industrial waste is "negative" for profit but "beneficial" for reputation).

### 5. Essential Mindsets for Problem Analysis
*   **"Multiple Benefits" Thinking (一举多得):** Seek solutions that yield numerous positive outcomes from a single action (e.g., multi-purpose use, killing two birds with one stone).
*   **Leveraging "Extendable Resources" (可拓资源):** Beyond controllable resources, identify and integrate "extendable resources" (those not owned but transformable for use) to achieve greater results with fewer direct inputs.
*   **"Innovation Unlimited" (创新无限):** Embrace the view that all problems are imperfect and can always be improved. Maintain a forward-looking perspective and continuously adjust strategies.
*   **Creative Thinking (创造性思维):** Analysis is a high-level cognitive activity driven by creative thinking, which is essential for innovative solutions. It involves deep understanding of problem essence and internal connections.

### 6. Defining Goals and Conditions
*   **Clear Goals are Paramount:** Explicit and precise goals are necessary for successful analysis and evaluation. Vague goals lead to uncertain outcomes.
*   **Prerequisites for Clear Goals:** Effective goal setting requires selecting the main analytical object and clearly defining the analysis theme.
*   **Goal Formalization and Digitalization:** Expressing goals in formal or numerical terms facilitates the identification of necessary elements, tools, and personnel.
*   **Goal Sequencing:** When multiple goals exist, establish hierarchical relationships and priority orders.
*   **Benefits of Clear Goals:** Foster positive mindset, provide motivation, shift focus to results, facilitate progress evaluation, and maximize analytical effort.
*   **Condition Definition:** Analyze and define resource conditions (internal/external) and environmental conditions (internal/external). Conditions can be transformed, and their nature (elastic/rigid, implicit/explicit, uncertain/certain) must be understood.
*   **Identifying Key Problems:** In complex situations, focusing on "key problems" can lead to significant breakthroughs (e.g., Liu Bei's "three visits to the thatched cottage" for Zhuge Liang).

### 7. Understanding the Nature of Crises
*   **Crisis Definition:** A crisis is a sudden, urgent problem with potential for significant harm to people, organizations, or resources.
*   **Key Characteristics of Crises:**
    *   **Suddenness (突发性):** Unpredictable in time, location, and intensity, often stemming from unforeseen factors, blind spots, or neglected hidden dangers.
    *   **Urgency (紧急性):** Crises release destructive energy rapidly, demanding immediate response; time for reaction and processing is extremely limited.
    *   **Harmfulness (危害性):** Crises cause direct and indirect damage (e.g., casualties, financial loss, environmental damage, psychological impact).
    *   **Conduciveness (传导性):** One crisis often triggers others, creating a ripple effect (e.g., 9/11 attacks impacting multiple industries).
    *   **Opportunity (机遇性):** Crises contain both danger and opportunity. Identifying and cultivating these opportunities is central to crisis management.
*   **Types of Crises (based on problem model contradictions):**
    *   Incompatibility between goals and conditions exceeding a threshold.
    *   Incompatibility between conditions exceeding a threshold.
    *   Incompatibility between goals exceeding a threshold.
*   **Crisis Management:** A process involving early warning, prevention, and handling to mitigate harm and exploit development opportunities. It is a distinct field with unique rules, procedures, and methods.

### 8. Mastering External Problem Relations and Interpersonal Strategies
*   **Responsibility (负责任):** Taking responsibility for problems and their impact, both on the issue itself and the affected parties, is crucial for satisfactory resolution.
    *   **Dare to be Responsible (敢于负责):** Requires a degree of adventurous spirit, even risking personal blame for the greater good (e.g., Kan Ze vouching for Lu Xun).
    *   **Skilled in Responsibility (善于负责):** Not just taking responsibility, but doing so intelligently and strategically, prioritizing the overall benefit (e.g., Su Yu changing battle plans).
    *   **Responsible for Self (为自己负责):** Adhering to one's word and actions, demonstrating integrity (e.g., Shang Yang's promise of gold, Fan Shi's keeping his word).
    *   **Responsible for Others/Collective/Nation (为他人/团体/国家负责):** Extending responsibility beyond oneself to the well-being of others, groups, or the state (e.g., Hua Xin's empathy, IBM staff's dedication, Carter's leadership).
*   **Harmony is Precious (以和为贵):** Prioritizing harmony for problem-solving.
    *   **Complementary Abilities & Tacit Coordination (能力互补，配合默契):** Leveraging individual strengths and compensating for weaknesses within a team to maximize collective potential (e.g., Cao Cao's generals defending Hefei, Liu Bang's use of Xiao, Zhang, Han).
    *   **Transforming Enemies into Friends (化敌为友):** Using a harmonious approach to de-escalate conflicts and foster cooperation (e.g., Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan's alliance against Chiang Kai-shek).
*   **Leaving Room for Others (给人留余地):** Creating leeway for others benefits oneself.
    *   **For the Opponent (为对方留余地):** Not cornering an opponent completely, which can lead to desperate resistance (e.g., Mao Zedong's strategy for peaceful liberation of Beiping, Suiyuan).
    *   **For Oneself (为自己留余地):** Acting cautiously and strategically to protect one's own position and future (e.g., Xiao He's careful conduct as Chancellor during Liu Bang's reign).

### 9. Internal Problem Logic and Principles
*   **Balance (平衡关系):** Many problems stem from an imbalance of interests. Maintaining equilibrium (political, economic, emotional, ethical, etc.) is key.
    *   **Give Before Taking (欲取先予):** Offering benefits or favors first to facilitate desired outcomes later, often playing on reciprocity (e.g., landowner building a university to develop commercial area, Zheng Banqiao's story).
    *   **Let Go Before Gaining (欲得先舍):** Being willing to concede something to resolve a problem or achieve a larger goal (e.g., Walter Watson's stamp collection story).
    *   **Leave Before Being Kept (欲留先去):** Demonstrating the value of something by temporarily withholding it or indicating its potential loss (e.g., Haydn's "Farewell Symphony").

    *   **Fairness in Method (方法上要公道):** Applying impartial methods, rational consideration, and empathetic understanding (e.g., mediating conflicts, comparing performance like the market manager example, Wang Sengqian's clever artistic comparison).
    *   **Consistency in Standards (标准上要统一):** Applying consistent criteria to avoid bias and ensure fairness, especially in sensitive decisions (e.g., criteria for employee layoffs, the saleswoman's negotiation).
*   **Moderation (过犹不及):** Adhering to the principle of appropriate measure, avoiding extremes.
    *   **Appropriate Action (举措适度):** Implementing measures that are precisely right for the situation, neither too little nor too much (e.g., China's unilateral ceasefire in the Sino-Indian war, the Sino-US Shanghai Communique).
    *   **Moderate Language (语言适度):** Communicating effectively by saying just enough, without overstating or being overly blunt (e.g., Zhang Yong advising Kou Zhun to read "Huo Guang Zhuan," Peng Dehuai's apology with a pear, Mao Zedong's assessment of Zhang Gan).

### 10. Understanding Problem Origins and Outcomes
*   **Root Cause Analysis (问题是从哪里来):** Investigate the reasons and origins of a problem from multiple angles to identify its core issues (e.g., Zhang Liang's analysis of potential rebellion after Liu Bang's victory, Liu Shaotang's analogy of editing an essay).
*   **Anticipating Outcomes (问题的结果又会是怎样):** Foreseeing the potential consequences of a problem, whether positive or negative, to avoid pitfalls (e.g., the restaurant owner's clever response to a political question, Zhou Enlai's witty answer about bank funds).
*   **Seeing Beyond the Surface (学会透过问题看本质):** Discerning the true nature of a problem beyond its superficial appearance to apply appropriate solutions (e.g., Zhou Enlai's response to the American reporter about his pen, the patient's retort to the rude nurse).
*   **Laying All Cards on the Table (把问题全部摆在桌面上):** Conducting a comprehensive analysis of a problem's genesis, development, and potential outcomes to choose the best solution (e.g., Zhuge Liang's detailed plan for defending Jingzhou, Sanmu Wuji's handling of the "scandal" question).

### 11. Strategic Problem-Solving Techniques
*   **Leveraging Strategic Abilities (谋略之能):** Employing strategic thinking for effective problem resolution.
    *   **Adapting to Trends (顺势而为):** Aligning actions with historical trends and broader movements for success (e.g., Mao Zedong re-employing Deng Xiaoping).
    *   **Leveraging External Forces (借力打力):** Utilizing external powers or situations to achieve one's objectives, especially when internal strength is insufficient (e.g., Feng Ting giving Shangdang to Zhao to provoke Qin, the clever tailor against giants).
    *   **Creating Advantage (创造优势):** Proactively shaping circumstances to gain a favorable position and momentum, often by making tactical movements that generate an advantageous "势" (momentum/situation) (e.g., Xie Xuan's strategy at the Battle of Fei River).
    *   **Controlling the Situation (控制局面):** Mastering the ability to guide and influence the development of a situation to one's advantage, enabling problem resolution (e.g., Liu-Deng's command in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu campaign).

    *   **Situational Adaptability (乘势应变法):** Transforming unfavorable situations into advantageous ones by understanding and leveraging dynamics (e.g., Han Xin's "battle with one's back to the river").

### 12. Intuition and Decision-Making
*   **Intuitive Analysis (直觉感):** Recognizing the role of intuition in decision-making, which can be faster and incorporate implicit knowledge.
    *   **Advantages:** Speed and integration of tacit knowledge.
    *   **Limitations:** May not consider all information, susceptible to inconsistency, and influenced by external factors (fatigue, distraction).
*   **Beyond Pure Intuition:**
    *   **Simple Filtering and Ranking:** Using basic rules to narrow down choices (e.g., choosing a restaurant, loan applications). Effective for broad classification but can be rigid and overlook nuances.
    *   **Occupational Reasoning (特殊职业上的常情推理):** Relying on established professional norms or common practices in specific fields.
*   **Risk of "Entry Rules" (入门规则):** While useful for screening, overly rigid "entry rules" can lead to overlooking qualified candidates or solutions that don't fit narrow criteria.

### 13. Structural Frameworks (纲要) for Problem Analysis
*   **Necessity of Frameworks:** Individuals simplify and organize information using "frameworks" (纲要) to manage complexity, enabling rational analysis.
*   **Blind Spots:** Frameworks inherently have "blind spots" as they focus on certain aspects while downplaying others, making it impossible to see the entire picture.
*   **Power of Frameworks:** Frameworks significantly influence problem-solving decisions, shaping how individuals and organizations react to problems. Poorly chosen frameworks can lead to severe consequences.
*   **Tailored Frameworks:** Effective analysts create specific frameworks for new problems, rather than applying generic ones.
*   **Understanding Your Framework:** Be aware of the scope, success criteria, and evaluation standards of your own analytical frameworks, as well as deeper underlying assumptions (引喻).
*   **Impact of Framing:** The way a problem is "framed" (e.g., as a lost ticket vs. lost money) can significantly alter perceived loss and subsequent decisions.
*   **Organizational Frameworks:** Different departments within an organization often operate under narrow, self-serving frameworks, hindering overall effectiveness. Leadership must foster holistic thinking.
*   **Standards and Analysis:** The standards used within a framework (e.g., absolute value vs. percentage savings) can lead to illogical decisions if not applied consistently.
*   **Metaphors (引喻) in Analysis:** Metaphors embedded in frameworks influence understanding. Good analysts select metaphors that highlight key aspects, while poor ones may oversimplify complex situations.
*   **Cultural Frameworks:** Deeply ingrained cultural frameworks can resist change even when environments evolve.
*   **Pitfalls of Incorrect Frameworks:** Frameworks can create illusions of completeness while hiding critical missing information, leading to flawed analysis.

### 14. Practical Training and Self-Improvement
*   **Risk & Failure:** View failure as a learning opportunity; don't fear exposure, as it hinders effective analysis.
*   **Rationalized Suggestions:** Encourage and respectfully discuss rationalized suggestions, responding promptly regardless of adoption.
*   **Visual Contact:** Practice maintaining eye contact to convey sincerity and influence others.
*   **Resource Management:** Report inadequate facilities to management with clear justification (cost/benefit) to secure necessary tools.
*   **Maximize Potential, Not Pressure:** Understand and leverage one's potential without undue stress, focusing on challenging but achievable tasks.
*   **Self-Management:** Engage in self-reflection to identify enjoyable tasks and integrate them into work or as rewards, utilizing good time management.
