Chapter 1
Aspect 1:
Clarify the definition of the problem
Accurately defining the problem
is the basis for solving the problem.
The analyst must first define the problem,
simplify the problem,
and clarify it,
to judge the importance of the problem.
Accurately define the problem for the customer,
is one of the keys to successful analysis.
I.
Definition of contradictory problems
Throughout human history,
From the time of Youchao,
Suiren,
Shennong to Yu the Great controlling the floods,
From the First Industrial Revolution to modern society,
humans have solved all kinds of contradictory problems,
enabling society to gradually move forward.
In this process,
The relationship between humans and nature can be divided into three stages:
The first stage is the stage of submission to nature:
The second stage is the stage of fighting against nature:
The third stage is,
With the development of science and technology,
humanity will enter an era of intellectual circles where we can harness nature,
and develop in harmony with nature.
·Chapter One, Aspect One:
Clarify the definition of the problem h 9
In the course of human social development,
there are all kinds of contradictions.
The history of mankind,
It is a history of solving contradictions.
According to the nature of the contradiction,
Contradictory problems can be divided into three types:
1. Incompatible contradictory problems
This type of contradictory problem refers to a problem caused by the contradiction between subjective desires and objective conditions.
For example,
Trying to use a small scale with a maximum weighing capacity of 100kg to weigh an elephant weighing several tons,
is an incompatible problem.
Solving this incompatibility problem was incomprehensible to Cao Cao's ministers,
but it was entirely possible for Cao Chong.
Cao Chong transformed the objective—
—
by changing "weighing an elephant" to "weighing stones," thereby turning the incompatibility problem into a compatibility problem.
Trying to move a 3-meter tall cabinet through a 2-meter tall door,
is also an incompatibility problem.
People solve this by "laying down" the cabinet—
—
that is, by transforming its features
And to solve the contradictory problem.
In the story of "besieging Wei to rescue Zhao" during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods,
The state of Qi wanted to achieve the goal of "rescuing Zhao,"
But it could not be solved due to "the long distance and urgency of time."
The State of Qi transformed its objective—
—
把
from "rescuing Zhao" to "besieging Wei," thereby resolving the siege of Zhao without a battle,
thus transforming an incompatible problem into a compatible one.
2. Opposing Contradictory Problems
This type of contradictory problem refers to achieving two or more objectives under the same conditions that cannot be achieved simultaneously.
For example,
To put a wolf and a chicken in the same cage,
without the wolf eating the chicken,
This opposition
10- Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
The problem can be solved by setting up fences in the cage;
The traffic rule in Hong Kong is that cars drive on the left.
In mainland China, traffic rules dictate that cars drive on the right.
After the reform and opening up,
To connect two traffic systems with different rules into one large system,
While respecting the traffic habits of both regions,
The way to resolve this opposition is the Huanggang Bridge, built in Huanggang, Shenzhen,
thus systematizing the opposing traffic systems into coexistence.
The function of Huanggang Bridge is to make cars from Hong Kong to the mainland naturally turn into right-hand driving after passing the bridge,
and also make cars from the mainland to Hong Kong naturally turn into left-hand driving after passing the bridge.
3. Objective contradiction problem
This type of contradiction problem refers to a problem constituted by the contradiction existing between objective problems.
Some objective contradiction problems can be solved through natural variation,
Most are solved through human intervention.
Use various methods to transform it into an incompatible or opposing problem.
Then transform it into compatibility or coexistence.
For example, if a plant wants to grow,
But it is attacked by pests and diseases,
Humans solve the problem of contradictions by using pesticides or the 'natural enemies' of insects.
Desertification of land
prevents plants from growing,
endangers the human survival environment.
The environment is deteriorating.
Humanity must use scientific methods to manage it.
Only then can problems be solved.
During the analysis,
There are all sorts of contradictions.
Faced with the problem of contradiction,
some people are helpless,
and some people have brilliant ideas.
Zhuge Liang's "Empty Fort Strategy," Sima Guang's "Smashing the Jar to Save the Person," Sun Bin's "Tian Ji Horse Racing,"
"Besieging Wei to Rescue Zhao" and other stories of ancient clever people,
have been passed down through generations.
The Art of War,
The Thirty-Six Stratagems, etc.
Chapter 1, Aspect 1:
Clarify the definition of the problem = 11
It also seems to have become a must-read book for analysts.
People always try to learn how to solve contradictory problems from "smart people."
So, are there any rules to follow when solving contradictory problems? Are there any methods to rely on? Can we use a formalized method to describe the process of people dealing with contradictory problems?
In order to make it easier for people to grasp the ideas for solving contradictory problems? Can human beings rely on certain laws to use computers to explore?
To analyze?
To make analysis activities more scientific,
and increase the success rate,
To enable humans to develop in greater harmony with nature in the process of resolving contradictions and problems? Let's talk about how to resolve the techniques of contradictory problems.
Generally speaking,
To resolve conflicts and problems,
There are three paths to choose from.
● Change the target.
If the target cannot be achieved under certain conditions,
However, if the conditions are difficult to change,
consider changing the goal of the problem.
For example:
"Cao Chong Weighs an Elephant" problem,
Under the conditions at the time,
The weighing capacity of the scale was difficult to change (for example, it could only weigh 100kg), meaning the conditions were difficult to change.
Cao Chong changed the goal of "weighing the elephant"
into "weighing stones," and stones have divisibility
It can be weighed with a small scale,
thereby resolving the contradiction.
● Change the conditions.
If the objective of the contradictory problem is not easy to change,
Then, consider changing the conditions of the problem.
●Transform both the goal and the conditions simultaneously.
In the process of solving many contradictory problems,
Often, transforming the goal or the conditions alone cannot resolve the contradiction.
At this point, consider changing both the objective and conditions of the problem.
A real estate developer wants to build a high-end residential garden.
After market research, it was found that
Many consumers want a residence that is both villa-style and garden-style.
Due to the humid weather in the south,
Customers don't want ground-floor residences.
To solve this contradictory problem,
The developer designed multiple duplex residences with rooftop gardens.
It is very popular among consumers.
This is an example of resolving contradictions by simultaneously changing the goal (not living on the ground floor) and the condition (having a garden on the ground).
To achieve "incompatibility becomes compatibility,"
The key to "opposition becomes coexistence" is to generate transformation methods.
Set up a translation bridge.
For example,
Huanggang Bridge in Shenzhen is a translation bridge that connects the opposing transportation systems of mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, making them coexist.
In many cases,
Contradiction is the driving force for people to reform,
and innovate.
Humanity is very
12 The nine aspects of super-analysis problems
Most inventions and creations are to solve contradictions,
Created to realize dreams.
Therefore,
In a sense,
generally speaking,
discovering or creating contradictions
is not necessarily a bad thing
Humanity develops and evolves by constantly resolving contradictions and problems.
Evolving.
Contradictions provide opportunities for human development.
II
The Extenics definition of the problem
Problems can all be expanded.
This possibility of expansion,
We call it the extensibility of the problem.
The extensibility of the problem includes divergence,
Relevance,
Implication and scalability,
It goes from the problem outwards,
Parallel,
The perspective of flexibility, combination, and decomposition offers multiple possible paths for transformation.
The expandability of a problem is an inherent property of the problem itself.
Based on these expandabilities,
we can formalize and analyze the expandability of the problem.
It provides the theoretical basis and appropriate tools for solving contradictory problems.
1. Divergence of extensible problems
Problems have multiple characteristics,
and one characteristic is shared by multiple problems.
"“One Object, Multiple Taxes”"
'"One Tax, Multiple Objects"'
'"One Tax, Multiple Values"'
'"One Value, Multiple Objects" are collectively referred to as the divergence of the problem.'
Fully utilize the divergence of the problem,
Multiple methods for solving contradictory problems can be generated.
Sometimes using one characteristic cannot solve a contradictory problem,
We can use other characteristics of the problem to solve it.
As in the example of \"moving a cabinet,\"
when the height of the cabinet is incompatible with the height of the door,
the cabinet can be \"laid down\" and its width can be used to be compatible with the height of the door to achieve the purpose.
When American food king Paul Volcker was very young,
Once ran a fruit stand selling fruit for the Bayshore chain store.
Baloch had just gained a foothold among the highly competitive fruit stalls,
when a very unfortunate thing happened:
The chain store's fruit storage cold storage plant caught fire.
By the time the fire brigade put out the fire,
18 boxes of aromatherapy products had already been yellowed by the fire,
and the skin was covered with many small black spots.
Besha sent these bananas to Boloch's rank.
Let him lower the price and sell it off.
The price doesn't matter,
as long as it sells.
Obviously,
Based on the product's image characteristics,
This product
Chapter 1, Aspect 1:
Clarify the definition of the problem t 13
Unsalable without a doubt,
Moreover, reducing the price does not necessarily guarantee a sale.
But the clever Borock tasted a banana,
and found the taste very special,
so he developed the divergent (roasted swallow, based on the principles of "one levy, multiple values" and "one item, multiple levies."
Image,
Ugly;
Roasted banana,
Image,
Different;
Roasted swiftlet nest,
Taste,
Unique), the shortcomings, features, and values of the product,
Diverged into advantages, features, and values,
These developments turned baked bananas into "imported,
Bananas with a unique flavor,
"Exclusive distribution" should of course be sold at a high price.
Coupled with Balochi's talent for speech and the on-the-spot "try before you buy," he quickly sold out 18 boxes of Xiangyan bananas at twice the market price.
2. Relevance of extension problems
Dependencies may exist between problems,
between certain characteristics of problems,
and between the characteristics of different problems.
All are possible.
We call it the relevance of the problem.
The product's price and quality,
Sales volume,
Profits, etc. are all relevant.
The output of a certain product is also related to the output of the product's accessories.
In the same problem,
if there is a correlation between the values of different features,
then transform one of the values.
leading to a change in the magnitude of another feature,
the latter is called the conduction transformation of the former.
For example,
Increase workers' wages,
and the workers' enthusiasm for work will be enhanced.
The consumption level of employees will also increase accordingly.
Because the problems are related to each other,
Therefore,
a change in the quantity value of a problem with respect to a certain feature
will cause a change in the quantity value of another problem with respect to that feature.
'Furthermore, it may lead to another problem regarding the change in the magnitude of another related feature.'
The latter is called the conductive transformation of the former.
For example, a unit introduces an expert with a high academic level.
14 Grasping the nine aspects of analyzing problems
This will inevitably lead to an improvement in the academic level of the unit.
Because the expert can receive more projects,
It can also increase the number of research projects in the unit,
And increase research funding.
During a miniskirt fashion trend in a certain year,
Pearl sales plummeted,
Precisely because clothing and accessories are related,
And those wearing miniskirts,
Generally, they don't wear pearl accessories.
Make full use of asking
The relevance of the question and its positive conduction effect,
It can increase the success rate of the analysis,
And prevent negative conduction.
This can reduce the possibility of analysis failure.
3. The implicitness of extensible problems
If problem A is realized,
There must be a problem B to implement;
Then problem A implies problem B.
"Besieging Wei to rescue Zhao" is a
good example of using implication to solve contradictory problems.
This kind of tactic is often used in modern business warfare.
The rags-to-riches story of American oil tycoon Rockefeller is intriguing.
His goal was to become the overlord of the oil industry.
But when people were rushing to engage in oil extraction that could reap huge profits at once,
He, however, put all the limited funds into the "downstream project"—
—
Petroleum refining.
Because he deeply knows,
Given his funds and capabilities at the time,
It is impossible to compete with so many competitors
So he decided to attack from the flank
Invest all strength and assets in the joints that people have not yet noticed.
Control oil refining,
And then control transportation,
And then disintegrate the oil production alliance in one fell swoop
Rockefeller used implication,
to rise from obscurity to become an oil tycoon.
Chapter One, Aspect One:
Clarify the Definition of the Problem - s 15
For example:
Company A, in order to acquire Company B, acquired 35% of the shares of Company B.
According to the company's articles of association,
Company A became the largest shareholder of Company B.
Has controlling interest.
To get rid of this situation, Company B
tried every possible means to mobilize a lot of power and
raised a lot of money.
'According to conventional methods,'
'The owner of Company B should have bought back his own shares to save his company from being controlled by others.'
'But the owner of Company B did not do this,'
'Instead, he secretly used these funds to acquire 35% of the shares of Company A (without Company A knowing), and instead became the largest shareholder of Company A.'
When Company A sent people to Company B to take over Company B,
Company B's
boss instead said:
"What right do you have to take over my company? Company A is now controlled by me."
I announce the revocation of all your positions!
This is a typical case of using implication for a "reverse takeover."
4. The expandability of extension problems
A question,
Can be combined with other issues to form new issues,
or can be broken down into several new issues,
These new problems formed through decomposition have certain characteristics that the original problem does not have.
We combine problems,
The possibility of decomposition,
collectively referred to as the scalability of the problem,
including additivity,
integrability, and separability.
The principle of extensibility is also to produce multifunctional,
Basis for versatile combination products.
In product sales,
Series of products are sold in bundled packages,
Products are sold separately, etc.
All are extensible applications.
A company has already purchased an ordinary machine tool for 15,000 yuan.
Due to production needs,
It plans to purchase a CNC machine tool.
The price of each CNC machine tool is 60,000 yuan.
To save expenses,
An engineer from the company analyzed the CNC machine tool,
and felt that the integrability of the problem could be utilized.
That is, CNC machine tool = ordinary machine tool × CNC system.
And the price of a CNC system is only 6,000 yuan.
In this way,
through their own technical transformation,
Saved the company approximately 39,000 yuan in one instance.
When software companies design and develop software,
the decomposability of problems is often applied,
that is, dividing the software into multiple parts.
Different personnel are responsible for designing different parts.
Finally, a few core personnel complete the overall connection.
In order to
achieve confidentiality.
When conducting sales layout analysis,
The scalability of the problem is often used.
To facilitate purchase and promote sales,
Merchants often use market survey results,
Divide the sales regions,
and place additive or integrable problems in the same sales region.
For example, baby clothes,
bedding,
Baby bottles,
toys, etc.,
are often placed in the same area,
unlike children's products
Clothes,
Bedding,
Toys and other items are placed in separate areas.
This is because infancy is short
Baby essentials are relatively few in variety.
Also, they are often purchased in combination.
Precisely because of this,
there are a particularly large variety of baby gift sets.
Manufacturers have also recognized this combined demand for baby products from consumers.
III.
What is the conjugacy of a problem?
Research on the structure of problems,
Helps us utilize the various parts of the problem to resolve contradictory issues.
Systems theory studies problems from the perspective of the system's components and internal/external relationships.
This is a description of one aspect of the problem's structure.
Through the analysis of a large number of real-world problems,
We have found that,
Besides being systematic,
the structure of a problem can also be studied from the perspectives of materiality,
dynamics, and opposition.
For example, Zhuge Liang in the Three Kingdoms period,
with thousands of old, weak, and disabled soldiers,
caused Sima Yi's 100,000 elite troops to retreat without a fight.
What Zhuge Liang used was definitely not the material aspect—
—
Thousands of old, weak, and disabled soldiers,
but used his non-material part—
—
the reputation of "being cautious all his life,"
thus achieving the success of the Empty Fort Strategy.
Therefore,
when studying the structure of a research question,
it is necessary to study both its material part,
and its non-material part.
In addition,
From the perspective of the dynamics of the problem,
Problems have both manifest and latent parts.
From the perspective of the opposition of the problem,
Problems have both negative and positive aspects.
The materiality of problems,
The systematic nature,
Dynamism and antagonism,
Collectively referred to as conjugation.
Approaching problems from the perspective of conjugation
can more completely describe the structure of the problem,
and more profoundly reveal the essence of the problem's development and changes.
Starting from these four perspectives,
Accordingly, we have proposed the concepts of virtuality and reality,
softness and hardness,
latency and obviousness,
The four pairs of opposing concepts, negative and positive, are used to describe the composition of the problem.
This is called the conjugate part of the problem.
Carefully studying the conjugate part of the problem and its mutual transformation
is the foundation of successful analysis.
Chapter One, Aspect One:
Clarifying the Definition of the Problem I —
17
1. Imaginary Part and Real Part
Consider the materiality of the problem,
Any problem consists of a material part and a non-material part.
We call the material part of the problem the real part of the problem.
The non-material part is called the imaginary part of the problem.
Reality is the foundation.
Treat the virtual as useful,
Combine the virtual and the real,
To create a thing.
The walls of the house,
Material parts such as ceilings and floors are the real part,
but we live in the space (imaginary part) they enclose:
The entity of the product is the real part,
while its brand,
Image,
reputation, etc. are the imaginary part;
A person's physical body and clothing are the real part,
A person's temperament,
Image,
Reputation,
Knowledge, etc., are imaginary parts.
For a company,
Funds,
Equipment,
Plant,
Products,
Personnel, etc., are actually part of the department.
Corporate image,
Popularity,
Technical level,
Management level, etc., are all its imaginary part.
In the analysis process,
it is necessary to pay attention to both the real part of the problem,
and also pay attention to the imaginary part of the problem.
The analysis can be an analysis of the real part of the problem,
that is, an analysis aimed at changing the real part of the problem,
or it can be an analysis of the
imaginary part of the problem
Analysis aimed at changing the imaginary part of the problem.
2. Soft Parts and Hard Parts
Considering the structure of the problem from a systemic perspective,
We call the entirety of the components that make up the problem the hard part of the problem.
The relationships between a problem and its components, and between that problem and other problems, are called the soft parts of the problem.
There are two common sayings in China:
"One monk carries water to drink,"
Two monks carry water together,
Three monks have no water to drink.
"Three cobblers with their wits combined"
Equal Zhuge Liang.
"This illustrates:"
The same three people,
whether they combine well or not,
has completely different effects.
18- Wei analyzes the nine aspects of the problem
I am a wolf from the North.
3. Latent and Manifest Parts
Considering the dynamics of the problem,
the problem is constantly changing,
Stillness is always relative,
Change is eternal.
Diseases have an incubation period,
Seeds have a germination process,
Eggs hatch into chicks at a certain temperature and within a certain time.
We call the potential part of the problem the latent part of the problem.
The manifested part is called the explicit part of the problem.
When we deal with problems,
Don't just limit yourself to the obvious parts of the problem,
but fully and comprehensively consider the hidden parts of the problem.
For example,
when designing urban power grids,
In addition to considering the existing electricity consumption departments (obvious departments),
It is also necessary to consider within a certain time period
Chapter 1, Aspect 1:
Clarify the definition of the problem = 19
Inside,
How many electricity users will increase or decrease (potential).
Like the electricity consumption of air conditioners for sale in department stores,
Hotels under construction,
Office buildings,
The electricity consumption of residential areas is potential,
If these potential electricity consumption are not considered,
once they are connected to the power grid,
This will lead to insufficient power supply.
In addition,
The power consumption of the power grid is also closely related to the country's economic situation.
When the economic situation is good,
Consumers' consumption levels will increase.
When the economy is down,
consumers' spending levels inevitably decline.
Therefore,
Strengthening the forecasting of the country's macroeconomic situation
is also conducive to forecasting potential consumers.
In a certain year, Guangzhou experienced a severe power shortage in the summer.
Blackouts occurred frequently.
Because the weather that year was particularly hot,
And the economic situation was good,
leading to a large increase in air conditioner users,
which the power sector had not anticipated.
Due to the severe overload of the power grid,
power outages occurred frequently,
To solve this problem,
the electricity department took measures of segmented power outages,
and rotating power usage,
which enabled the power system to work normally
This problem has seriously affected the lives and work of citizens.
Later, the power department carried out power grid transformation,
which completely solved this type of problem.
4. Negative part and positive part
Considering the opposition of the problem,
Any problem has two opposing aspects.
The opposition of a problem is relative to a certain characteristic.
The quantity value of a problem regarding a certain characteristic is the result of the combined effect of the part that generates positive values and the part that generates negative values within the problem.
We call the part of the problem where the magnitude of a certain feature takes a positive value the positive part of the problem with respect to that feature.
We call the part of the problem where the magnitude of a certain feature takes a negative value the negative part of the problem with respect to that feature.
When dealing with problems,
it is important to correctly distinguish between "positive and negative" and "pros and cons".
For example, regarding a company's profit,
Waste water,
Waste gas,
Waste residue all need to be treated
These parts regarding the values of profits are negative,
hence they are the negative aspects of the enterprise;
Because "three wastes" cause environmental pollution,
they are the "disadvantages" of the enterprise.
and the employee welfare department,
kindergarten,
and the propaganda department's values for profit are also negative,
is also a negative department,
But these parts can improve the work enthusiasm of employees,
enhance the corporate image,
so it is "beneficial" to the enterprise
20 f Nine aspects of analyzing problems
'of the postal points.'
In other words,
The negative part of a certain feature,
也
can be a part that is beneficial to the problem,
or it can be a part that is detrimental to the problem.
When analyzing a problem,
it is important to pay special attention to the negative and positive aspects of the problem,
and make full use of them.
IV.
What kind of thinking should you have when analyzing problems?
1. The idea of ​​killing two birds with one stone
Any problem involves a lot of analysis,
According to the extensibility of the problem,
A thing or object has many characteristics,
And a characteristic can be shared by many things or objects at the same time:
To complete a task,
It often requires doing many things to lay the groundwork;
Doing one thing,
often leads to the occurrence of many related things.
If many problems caused by one thing produce beneficial effects,
it is called "killing many birds with one stone."
"Multiple uses for one thing"
"Killing two birds with one arrow"
"Killing two birds with one stone"
"“Skinning five hides off one cow” and other sayings embody this idea."
Applying this idea when analyzing problems
can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

'2. The Extenics resource idea of "using other people''s resources to do one''s own thing"'
We know that
doing anything requires various resources.
In the traditional view of resources,
we often focus on the resources we can control,
which are controllable resources.
This way of thinking determines that our use of resources is "living within our means," while
When dealing with problems, a large number of resources need to be used.
'There are different kinds of resources (available resources), which widely exist in society and nature.'
Those that do not belong
to our own,
Resources that can be used for one's own purposes after certain transformations are called.
are called extensible resources.
Based on the idea of extensible resources,
the focus of resource analysis is not on the controllable resources it owns,
Rather, it is about transforming the available resources needed into expandable resources.
Integrating all kinds of needed available forces
together,
and turning them into forces that you can use.
To accomplish bigger things with fewer resources.
3. Limitless Innovative Thinking
Extension theory believes that,
All problems are imperfect,
All can be explored and developed.
can be improved.
Screening of problems,
It can only obtain a relatively optimal solution.
22 Grasp nine aspects of analyzing problems
In addition,
Since problems are constantly evolving,
Therefore, no problem should be absolute.
should be adjusted according to the development of the situation,
and the passage of time.
即
Even if it is the best solution now,
it may be an obsolete solution in the future.
The idea that "all problems are imperfect,"
which is the idea of "infinite innovation,"
is especially important for analysts,
it can make analysts never satisfied,
Always strive for higher goals.
It also enables analysts to conduct analysis with a developmental perspective.
And continuously adjust during the implementation of the analysis.
So that the results of the implementation exceed the goals set during the analysis.
4. The idea of using creative thinking for analysis
Analysis is an advanced and complex rational thinking activity.
The soul of this activity is creative thinking,
which runs through the entire process of analysis.
The essence of analysis is innovation and
seeking change.
Everything should be new,
and novelty is the charm of the problem.
An outstanding analysis should be "outstanding creativity + the greatest expected effect of realization possibilities."
Outstanding creativity + the greatest expected effect of realization possibilities."
It can be seen from this that
Analysis without creative thinking can only be a lifeless dogma.
Creative thinking is a deep understanding and grasp of the essential attributes and internal connections of the analyzed object.
It occupies a very important position in the analysis process.
And this is often the most difficult part for analysts to grasp.
But creative thinking is by no means unconstrained.
Boundless,
It has a pattern to follow.

V.
Analyze the objectives and conditions of the problem
The Japanese standard is the basis of our actions.
A British proverb says it well:
"For a ship sailing blindly,"
Any wind is the wrong wind.
"Like a high jumper,"
If there isn't a bar in front of him,
And he's allowed to high jump freely without any target,
It's certain that
He will never be able to achieve good results.
'1. The objective of the analysis must be clear.'
Goals create beliefs,
Clear goals create firm beliefs,
It's difficult to succeed with a vague goal.
The first woman to swim the English Channel—
—
Florence Chadwick, a 34-year-old American,
decided to swim another, more distant strait—
—
Catalina Channel Challenge,
That is, swimming from Catalina Island, 21 miles west of the California coast, to the California coast.
That day,
a thick fog blanketed the sea,
She could barely see the escort ship.
The freezing seawater numbed her body.
15 hours had passed,
She felt tired and cold.
Finally decided to give up.
Requested escort, the boat pulled her aboard.
The coach and her mother on board told her that the coast was near.
Don't give up.
But as she looked towards the California coast,
a thick fog was rolling in,
and she couldn't see anything! After she had been swimming for 15 hours and 55 minutes,
people pulled her onto the boat—
—
It's only half a mile from the California coast! Later, she concluded,
It wasn't fatigue that made her give up halfway,
Nor was it the cold,
But because she couldn't see the target in the heavy fog.
Vague goals,
Shook her beliefs.
Two months later,
Due to having a clear goal in her heart,
She successfully swam across the strait.
So,
Clearly and accurately set goals,
is for analysts to solve a problem,
The necessary prerequisite for achieving a certain effect,
and also the basis for evaluating and analyzing plans,
and assessing the results of implementation.
The so-called goal,
It's the expected value from analysis to implementation.
to analyze whether it is good or bad.
Usually judged by the result,
and this judgment is quite easy as long as it is compared with the target value.
Clarified.
Therefore,
Only when your goal is clarified,
is it easier to evaluate the results.
2. Clearly define the prerequisites for the analysis target.
Analysis is to maximize the use of the limited resources that the organization has,
and the "wisdom" to combine and use them.
Therefore,
It is necessary to select the primary object from multiple analysis objects,
and invest limited wisdom and time
into it with focus.
After filtering analysis objects based on some standard,
Select the main analysis object.
Set the analysis theme.
Then, clarify the analysis theme.
For example,
A company has the following analysis topics:
(1) Analysis to increase turnover.
(2) Promotional analysis to increase turnover.
(3) Promotional analysis to increase the turnover of product A.
(4) Promotional analysis to increase the turnover of Product A by 50%.
(5) Promotional analysis to increase the turnover of Product A by 50% this year.
(6) In order to improve the...
Shanghai area Product A turnover target of 50%.
Promotional analysis of expanding wholesale marketing channels.
From this, it can be seen that,
From (1) to (6), the theme becomes clearer and clearer.
If it is an analysis of theme (1),
Then it's not limited to promotional analysis,
but also from advertising,
price reductions,
and adding new products,
Demonstration in the downtown area,
Consider analysis using various means such as press releases. At the same time, the product is not limited to product A,
The region may also target the whole country.
This kind of very free analysis topic seems to allow one to play as one pleases,
Actually, due to unclear sub-goals,
it is very likely to produce an analysis that deviates from the analyst's intention.
If the theme can be as clear as in (6),
namely time,
Region,
Specific objectives such as turnover targets are very clear,
which is particularly conducive to the smooth progress of the analysis.
Therefore,
Clearly defining the problem is a prerequisite for clarifying the analysis goal.
Before latent semantic analysis,
it is best to first determine the analysis object and
seriously discuss with the person who decides the topic.
Only after the analysis theme is completely clear,
Then proceed to the substantive operation.
Chapter 1, Aspect 1:
Clarify the definition of the problem 25
When determining the analysis objectives,
There is often more than one objective.
At this time,
it is necessary to use the implication analysis method,
to determine the hierarchy of analysis objectives,
For goals at the same level,
it is also necessary to determine the priority order of each goal.
Usually, we consider more about analyzing the contradiction between goals and conditions,
that is, the incompatibility problem.
However, there generally should be no contradictions between multiple analysis targets of the same analysis subject.
If different goals of two analysis subjects are to be considered simultaneously under the same conditions,
or two goals of the same analysis subject,
if contradictions arise between the goals,
Then it belongs to the opposition problem.
Achieving goals requires progressing step by step from lower to higher levels.
As for setting goals,
it involves breaking them down layer by layer from high to low levels.
If there is only one top-level objective,
it is called a single-objective problem;
If there are multiple top-level objectives,
it is called a multi-objective problem.
In problem analysis,
all objectives constitute a goal implication system.
The realization of lower-level objectives implies the realization of higher-level objectives,
and there may be some correlation between objectives at the same level.

5. Clarify the role of the goal
● Clear goals create a positive mindset.
The goal is the basis of effort,
It is also an incentive for people.
A clear goal gives people a visible destination.
● A goal is a motivation.
With a clear goal,
will concentrate energy and resources on the chosen direction and goal,
and therefore will be more enthusiastic.
●A clear goal shifts the focus from the process to the result.
The measure of success is not how much work you have done,
But rather, how much achievement was obtained.
● Clear goals,
Helps in evaluating progress.
Formalized,
Digital objectives,
concretize the ideas in the analyst's mind,
to make ideas concrete,
easier to achieve.
Clear goals also provide an important means of evaluation,
that is, a standard,
or rather, the analysis target is an important indicator to measure the implementation effect of an analysis plan.
.
●Clear goals enable analysts to concentrate their efforts to the greatest extent,
Contributes to the success of the analysis.
An American philosopher of the 19th century,
The poet Emerson said:
"The person who is single-mindedly moving towards his goal,"
The whole world makes way for him!
After defining the goal of problem analysis,
next we need to
analyze and define the conditions.
Conditional packages include resource conditions and environmental conditions.
Resource conditions include internal resources and external resources.
Environmental conditions include internal and external environments.
Conditions are mostly objective.
But conditions can be transformed.
They can be changed.
Among the many conditions,
some are beneficial to achieving the analysis goal.
Some are unfavorable to the analysis target;
Some are compatible with the analysis target;
Some are contradictory to the analysis target;
Some conditions are
Chapter One, Aspect One:
Clarify the definition of the problem h 27
Non-restrictive conditions,
Some conditions are restrictive.
All conditions
must be clearly defined.
Due to the limitations of objective or artificial conditions,
people are subject to corresponding restrictions when trying to achieve their goals.
When determining constraints,
be sure to clearly define the nature of the constraints:
Are they elastic constraints or rigid constraints?
Are they implicit constraints or explicit constraints?
Is it uncertainty constraint or deterministic constraint?
Only by correctly determining the nature of the constraints,
is it conducive to the analysis of conditions.
In fact,
The problems in many analysis activities are very complex.
When defining the problem,
If we can use the idea of 'using minimal force to move a great weight',
First find the key problem,
Then you can receive unexpected results.
In the late Eastern Han Dynasty,
heroes
were in separate regimes.
Liu Bei wanted to dominate the world,
and gathered Guan Yu,
Zhang Fei,
Zhao Yun and other brave generals.
Sima Hui, however, believed that Liu Bei's key problem was the lack of a strategist who could plan and strategize.
Thus came about Liu Bei's "thrice visiting the thatched cottage."
In the very complex environment at the time,
How to break the deadlock,
Develop power? Before Kong Ming left his thatched cottage,
he proposed the innovative idea of "dividing the world into three parts."
​
Kong Ming's analysis of this idea,
Enabled Liu Bei to proclaim himself emperor in Western Shu,
Achieving hegemony,
Realizing Liu Bei's ultimate goal of dominating the world.
From this, it can be seen that,
In a market economy,
To win in fierce competition,
one must conduct careful and thorough analysis,
especially analysis of issues related to survival,
It is necessary to be especially cautious.
Otherwise,
you might "lose one move,
and lose the whole game."
But "prudence"

VI.
The original problem contains both "danger" and "opportunity"
1. Definition of Crisis
"Crisis" originally means a critical juncture of serious difficulty.
It extends to mean a dangerous and urgent state caused by unexpected problems.
Regarding the definition of the term 'crisis',
Many researchers, from different perspectives,
have expounded their own viewpoints.
Opinions vary.
Different people have different views.
Some researchers even use other terms to describe it,
such as emergencies,
Disaster,
adversity, etc.
Although the ways of expression are different,
the contents of the expression have different focuses,
But all, to some extent, interpret the essence of the crisis.
For example:
●American lexicographer Noah Webster defines "crisis" as:
"A turning point, for better or worse,
A decisive moment,
A critical period of time,
and a situation that has reached a critical point.
”
●American crisis management expert Ian I Mitroff has always tried to avoid making an accurate and general definition of \"crisis,\"
because he insists that managing a crisis is more important than defining it.
Nevertheless,
He still gave a "guiding definition": "A crisis is a problem that can or has the potential to affect the organization as a whole."
"
●American philosopher T.H. Kuhn believes that a crisis is \"a stage of transition from normal science to scientific revolution, from the old paradigm to the new paradigm.\"
When anomalies increase and develop to a certain extent,
When the adjustment and assimilation of the paradigm repeatedly fails,
thus posing a fundamental threat to the paradigm,
Crisis is coming.
● Management guru Barton believes:
"A crisis is an uncertain issue that can cause potentially negative impacts,"
This problem and its consequences can have a huge impact on organizations and their employees.
products,
services,
assets and reputation,
causing enormous damage to their image.
”
◆Rosenthal and Pijnenburg both believe:
"“A crisis refers to a situation with serious threats,"
uncertainty, and a sense of urgency.
”
● British crisis management expert Robert Heath believes:
Chapter 1, Aspect 1
Clarifying the Definition of the Problem - 1 Coin 29
"A crisis encompasses three scenarios:
① A threat to personnel and resources;
② Out of control;
③ Visible and invisible impact on personnel,
organizations, and resources.
”
● American crisis management expert Steven:
Steven Fink believes that:
"A crisis is an unstable period or state of affairs in which a problem is about to undergo a decisive change."
In summary of the above definitions,
the basic connotation of crisis can be defined as:
"Various urgent"
Unexpected occurrences
To personnel
Sudden problems that cause significant damage or potential significant damage to organizations and other resources.
2. Basic characteristics of crisis issues
Based on the interpretation of the basic connotation of crisis,
Crisis issues generally have the following characteristics.
● Suddenness.
The suddenness of a crisis refers to the time when a crisis occurs,
the location where it occurs,
the manner in which it erupts,
and the degree of its eruption, etc
People are always caught off guard,
and difficult to grasp accurately.
It reflects the great contingency and randomness of crisis issues.
People's perception of the suddenness of crisis issues is manifested in the following three aspects:
First, a crisis is triggered by objective factors that are difficult for people to control.
such as
earthquakes,
and sudden outbreaks of natural disasters such as floods;
Secondly, the crisis erupted in people's blind spots of perception.
For example, Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol capsules were poisoned without any prior warning,
结
resulting in the death of patients after taking them.
Thirdly, subtle details that people are accustomed to ignoring lead to danger
Nine aspects of grasping and analyzing problems
opportunity,
or hidden dangers that people painstakingly try to conceal,
a crisis caused by a sudden and widespread outbreak,
For example,
A certain company deliberately concealed for 15 consecutive years the truth that its breast augmentation material (silicone) may rupture or leak after use,
thereby endangering
human health.
After this truth was revealed by the media,
the company quickly fell into crisis,
and filed for bankruptcy protection.
● Urgency.
The urgency of crisis issues is reflected in two aspects:
On the one hand, once a crisis breaks out,
it will rapidly release the destructive energy accumulated during its incubation period in a very short period of time,
and spread quickly
showing a trend of extreme spread.
If effective measures are not taken in time to deal with it,
the crisis will be out of control in a short period of time,
especially after the rapid development of information technology has greatly shortened the space-time distance,
Making even small mistakes quickly escalate into huge waves.
On the other hand,
The outbreak of a crisis leaves people with reaction,
analysis,
The processing time is extremely limited.
Such as plane crashes,
Stadium riots,
Fire,
Crisis issues such as car crashes,
occur in an extremely short period of time.
Car accidents often happen within 1 to 2 seconds.
However, during stadium riots, people are left with no escape in just 1 to 2 minutes.
Similar scenarios exist for other types of crises.
For example,
a Sino-foreign joint venture pharmaceutical factory,
after its cold medicine containing PPA (phenylpropanolamine) was declared by the China National Drug Administration to be suspended from sale,
Overnight, it disappeared from the pharmaceutical market without a trace.
The company's product market suddenly entered a slump.
● Harmfulness.
The harmfulness of crisis issues refers to the potential harm that a crisis can cause to personnel.
Organizations and other resources cause a wide range of direct and indirect damage.
The more severe the crisis,
其
Chapter One, Aspect One:
Clarify the definition of the problem 31
The greater the scope of the harm and the destructive power,
the more devastating the losses.
This kind of damage is not only reflected in casualties,
but also in the disappearance of organizations,
loss of property and environmental damage,
and also reflected in the destructive impact of the crisis on social and individual psychology,
and then penetrates and affects all levels of social life.
For example,
The "9/11" terrorist attacks in the United States,
The direct hazards are the loss of aircraft,
the collapse of buildings,
and casualties.
The indirect hazard is that many industries in the United States have suffered a catastrophe unprecedented in a century
The aviation industry (transportation and manufacturing) alone suffered losses of up to $10 billion.
Plus, nearly 100,000 employees were laid off.
According to a report released by the United Nations,
The "9/11" terrorist attacks would reduce the world economic growth rate by one percentage point that year.
Losses amounted to $350 billion.
In addition to the heavy blow to the US economy,
the economic growth of other countries and regions will also be affected to varying degrees.
● Transmissibility.
The transmissibility of crisis problems refers to the fact that one crisis problem often leads to another.
A crisis problem that has already broken out,
is both the "result of a cause" and the "cause of a result." Like a stone thrown into water causing ripples,
it will also have a series of effects on the outside world.
Even initial minor crises can trigger larger crises.
Take the "9/11" terrorist attacks as another example.
This event not only caused the American aviation industry to suffer heavy losses,
plunging into a business crisis.
and affecting finance,
insurance,
news media,
tourism and many other industries,
At the same time, it raised the American public's panic to an unprecedented level.
Bringing serious psychological trauma.
And ultimately led the United States to take military action against Afghanistan.
And a series of crisis issues such as anthrax mailings.
Opportunistic.
The opportunistic nature of crisis issues means that although crisis issues are difficult to completely avoid,
some crises also contain opportunities.
Just as the Chinese word "crisis" has the dual meaning of "danger" and "opportunity."
A crisis is like a watershed,
It has the potential to get worse,
And it also has the potential to get better.
Every crisis contains the seeds of failure,
Also nurturing the seeds of success.
Discovery,
Cultivating and nurturing this potential opportunity for success is the essence of crisis management.
3. Basic Types of Crisis Issues
The number of crisis issues is large,
and they vary greatly in type,
and the scope they cover is extremely broad,
therefore,
It is impossible for us to list all crisis issues one by one.
Although as
Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
A mismatch between goals and conditions can cause a crisis.
Crisis issues can be broadly divided into the following three types:
Therefore,
We still need to classify the basic types of crisis issues.
The purpose of doing this is:
It can give us a clear understanding of potential crisis issues:
It enables us to understand the different characteristics of crisis issues of different natures;
This helps us to take different approaches and measures in advance in a targeted manner to deal with different types of crisis issues.
Due to the different starting points of classification,
The divided cris-
is problem types are also different.
In this section,
We will base on the conflicting pairs in the problem model.
● Crises caused by incompatibility between goals and conditions exceeding a certain threshold.
This type of crisis originates from the contradiction (i.e., incompatibility) between goals and conditions.
When the incompatibility between the target and the conditions is within a certain threshold,
the crisis problem is in a latent state;
When the incompatibility is greater than this threshold,
the crisis problem breaks out.
In a manifested state.
Such as floods,
when the river's flood discharge capacity is less than the flood's flow,
or when the dam's flood storage capacity is less than the flood's volume,
Disasters will inevitably break out.
A crisis caused when the degree of incompatibility between conditions exceeds a certain threshold.
The root cause of this type of crisis is the conflict between two or more conditions under the same goal.
Such as the creation of some interpersonal relationships,
This lies in the conflict between people's internal and external conditions,
Or there is a conflict between the various internal conditions of people.
● A crisis caused by the incompatibility between goals exceeding a certain threshold.
这
Chapter 1, aspect 1,
Clarify the definition of the problem - 33
A class of crises arises from the intensification of contradictions between two or more goals that cannot be achieved simultaneously under the same conditions.
The result is a sharp contradiction between two or more goals that cannot be achieved simultaneously under the same conditions.
For example, the emergence of terrorist activities lies in the fact that the goals pursued by terrorists are contrary to the goals pursued by mankind;
For example, in legal proceedings, a crisis arises when the goals of the parties involved conflict.
Or, there is a conflict between the goals pursued by the organization and the goals set by relevant laws.
4. Crisis management
The most prominent characteristic of a crisis is that
Its potential factors exist all the time,
Everywhere.
A slight relaxation and neglect of thought
Will lead to great disaster.
When a sudden "crisis" strikes,
How should we deal with it? This is an important new topic that some management experts at home and abroad are dedicating themselves to studying:
an important new topic they are dedicating themselves to studying:
"Crisis Management."
"
The term "crisis management" officially appeared in the 1986 book "Crisis Management:
Planning for the Inevitable."
The author of the book, Steven Fink, participated in the handling of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in the United States in 1979.
Afterwards,
He has conducted a relatively systematic study of crisis management.
Currently,
There are two main development trends in foreign crisis management:
First, it is becoming a growing industry.
Basically realized industrialization.
Many experts in crisis management have founded
crisis management consulting firms,
providing professional consulting services on crisis management to all sectors of society.
Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
Affairs;
Second, many large companies have regarded crisis management as a new discipline (or "new challenge") for the company.
For a long time,
There are many summaries of successful experiences,
There is a lot of research on how to get on the road to success,
But there is less research on crises and their management.
Moreover, in China,
People generally lack a strong sense of crisis.
Not only is there a weak awareness of crisis prevention,
but more seriously, even when a crisis has already occurred, people remain indifferent.
Without any remedial measures.
Crisis management is a process that involves crisis early warning,
crisis prevention,
crisis handling,
in order to achieve avoidance,
The process of reducing the harm and losses caused by a crisis,
and opening up development opportunities from the crisis.
The connotation of crisis management
indicates that crisis management, as an important field of management science,
It has its own unique laws,
procedures, and methods.
Therefore,
it is necessary to study the basic concepts of crisis management,
Theories and methods,
and avoiding,
navigating,
Systematically studying the skills to resolve crises,
Furthermore, through effective crisis early warning,
prevention, and handling,
reduce the harm and losses of crises,
and be able to turn crises into opportunities.
Create a new landscape of development.

A failing attitude can be critical to analyzing and addressing problems.
In everyday life, failure is often seen as an indelible stain.

Instead, learn actively.
This is what happens when you fail.
An effective way to avoid risks.
In most cases,
You are always afraid of others seeing your failures.
This is a huge negative factor,
It leads to poor analysis,
And therefore cannot solve problems well.
Especially in an increasingly competitive social environment,
This is unacceptable—

In social life.
People always have to face problems,
and always have to analyze problems.
When a problem arises, how do you analyze it?
How can problems be handled to satisfy most people?
How to handle the problem in a way that meets everyone's requirements?
How to handle problems in a way that benefits both oneself and others?
This is really not a simple thing.
I.
Respect the internal balance of the problem.
Many problems in life arise
are due to imbalances in interests.
Therefore,
When analyzing problems,
we must adhere to the principle of balancing interests.
Chapter Two, Aspect Two:
The internal logical relationship of the habit clearing problem h 39
The balance of interests is multifaceted:
There is political balance,
There is economic balance,
There is emotional balance,
There is moral balance,
There is balance in action,
There is balance in speech,
There is a balance in concept,
There is a balance in form, and so on.
No matter which aspect,
Once these interests are out of balance,
contradictions will arise,
the intensification of contradictions,
becomes a problem that must be dealt with.
Therefore,
When we analyze problems,
First, we must adhere to the principle of balanced interests.
1. Give before you take.
In social life, people
always want to get something, such as seeking fame and fortune,
Seeking profit and gain,
Seeking honor and glory,
Seeking wealth and high position…
…
But no matter what you seek, from a positive perspective,
It's always better to give first.
The saying goes, "If you want to take something,
you must first give."
"Giving" is for "taking," for being more proactive.
Officials can obtain it with certainty.
That's the idea.
In a suburb of an American city,
there is a barren piece of land that has been unusable for more than fifty years.
One day,
the landowner finally came up with an idea,
he went to the local government department,
and said to the official:
"This piece of land of mine is free of charge,"
"How about I let you build a university?" The local government gladly accepted his suggestion,
and immediately allocated funds,
organized construction,
In just over a year, a sizable institution of higher learning was established.
Where there is a university, there are students,
Where there are students, there is spending.
The landowner, due to his righteous act of donating land to build the school,
Easily obtained government support,
Built apartments outside the school gate,
Restaurants,
Shopping malls,
Ying Shua Yuan, etc.,
forming a commercial street.
In just one year,
the loss of land gifted,
And earned it back from commercial operations.
It is a glorious thing to donate land to build schools,
To serve the cause of education,
It is also reasonable to make a certain profit.
It can be said that I am skilled at giving,
and I take in a principled way.
《The Art of War · Laying Plans》 says:
"Now the calculations in the temple, before battle, that indicate victory show that one has obtained much,"
'Gaining more calculations leads to more victories:'
'If, before a battle, the calculations in the temple indicate no chance of victory,'
'It means fewer calculations lead to defeat.'
'More calculations lead to victory,'
To calculate little and not win is a loss,
How much more so if there is no calculation at all?” “Temple calculation” means to discuss and
plan,
which is to strategize.
This land boss is precisely skilled in strategic planning.
He cleverly used the art of giving and taking.
Turning a desolate hillside,
into a commercial treasure trove with a rolling source of wealth.
There's a Chinese saying: "He who eats another's food is bound to obey."
Once you accept favors from someone,
or take advantage of someone's generosity,
it becomes difficult to refuse their requests.
Just not so embarrassed to ask.
.
Chinese people value relationships,
emphasize face,
"A drop of water in need shall be repaid with a spring."
Intelligent people use this method,
and it almost always works.
Zheng Banqiao, a famous calligrapher and painter of the Qing Dynasty and a representative figure of the \"Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou,\" was the first to be hit by this sugar-coated bullet,
and suffered in silence.
A wealthy tycoon had just built a new villa,
Luxurious and magnificent,
But it lacked a bit of cultural atmosphere.
Someone suggested,
Why not get a couple of Zheng Banqiao's calligraphies and paintings?
Hang them in the living room,
Wouldn't that be refined and unconventional?
However,
Zheng Banqiao relied on his talent
and was arrogant,
disdained power and responsibility,
some high-ranking officials and nobles wanted to ask for his calligraphy and paintings,
Even if I pushed a cart full of silver,
I would be turned away.
What should I do? After much thought,
The wealthy man finally had an idea.
Therefore,
he sent his men to inquire about Zheng Banqiao's living habits and various hobbies.
He learned that Zheng Banqiao especially liked to drink alcohol with dog meat.
He then had a plan in mind.
One day,
Zheng Banqiao went
out for a walk,
when he suddenly heard a melodious sound of a zither coming from afar
Melody
How elegant,
I couldn't help but feel curious,
I haven't heard of anyone around here playing the zither. So,
Following the sound,
I discovered the music was coming from a residence.
The courtyard door was ajar,
Zheng Banqiao pushed the door open and entered,
The scene before his eyes surprised him greatly:
The courtyard was filled with lush green bamboo,
and an abundance of bizarre rocks,
Within the bamboo forest, an old man with white hair and a youthful face,
Silver beard flowing,
Playing the zither and singing.
Oh my,
Isn't this clearly a picture?
The old man saw him,
and stopped abruptly.
Zheng Banqiao felt a little embarrassed for spoiling their fun,
but the old man didn't mind at all
He was warmly invited to take a seat.
The two discussed poetry and music.
Quite
Chapter Two, Aspect Two:
The logical relationship within the Lianqing problem
Speculation.
In the middle of a lively conversation,
Suddenly,
A strong smell of dog meat wafted over.
Zheng Banqiao felt very
surprised,
but his saliva was already uncontrollably flowing.
In a little while,
a servant was seen carrying a pot of wine,
and a large pot of overripe leopard meat,
and delivered it to them.
At the sight of dog meat,
Zheng Banqiao's eyes were glued to it.
The old man had just uttered the word "please,"
He even forgot the polite formalities of pretending to decline
Devouring and gorging impatiently.
Finishing the dog meat like the wind sweeping away fallen leaves,
Zheng Banqiao then realized,
He hadn't even asked for the other person's name yet,
I just ate and drank a lot at their place without really knowing what was going on.
Now that I'm full and satisfied, I can't just leave with a flick of my sleeve,
and say "goodbye" and just walk away!
However,
How should I thank them? Should I leave some money?
It's not only too vulgar,
but also, I didn't bring any money with me for my walk.
So,
He said to the old man:
"It is my honor to meet you today,
It's a real pleasure to meet you.
Thank you for your kind hospitality.
I can't possibly repay you.
Please find some paper and a pen
Let me draw a few strokes,
Consider it a memento.
The old man seemed a little embarrassed,
and said repeatedly:
"Treating someone to a meal is just a small matter,"
Why bother about it!
Zheng Banqiao thought he didn't like calligraphy and painting,
So he boasted:
"Although my calligraphy and paintings are not top-notch,"
They can still be exchanged for silver.
"Only then did the old man find paper and brushes,"
Zheng Banqiao finished painting,
He then asked the old man's name.
The old man told him.
Zheng Banqiao felt his ears burning.
But he couldn't remember it.
They even added "Respectfully presented to so-and-so" at the end.
Seeing the old man's satisfied smile,
they then bid farewell and left.
The next day,
These few cosmic paintings are hanging in the living room of the big tycoon Biden.
The tycoon also invited guests
to appreciate them together.
The guests originally thought he had bought them from elsewhere at a high price,
But as soon as he saw his name on the calligraphy and painting,
he believed that it was Zheng Banqiao who painted it specially for him.
After the news spread,
Zheng Banqiao could hardly believe his ears.
He went to search again along the route he had taken that day,
and discovered it was an uninhabited house,
only then did he realize
that he was greedy for dog meat,
Unexpectedly, I fell into someone else's trap.
I've been tricked!
"The reason why the tactic of 'give before you take' is so successful"
lies in the fact that it conforms to people's psychological pattern of reciprocity.
Generally blind,
whatever you do is actually a pursuit of some kind of interest.
To obtain a certain benefit,
It is necessary to maintain a relatively stable balance of interests.
That is to say, you can't always be headstrong when it comes to matters of interest,
One-sided,
不
Allowing the other party to pay unilaterally,
And you always have to gain something before or after the payment.
'This kind of gain is certainly not limited to the material, but also includes the spiritual and'
emotional.
Therefore,
It is based on this kind of balance of interests in the world,
People then have the analytical method of wanting to take, but first giving.
2. Give up first, then gain
When analyzing problems, many unexpected situations often arise.
For example, the other party makes excuses to delay,
Hinting at bribery,
Let's take a look, etc.
At this moment,
In order to settle the problem,
In chess, you can "sacrifice a pawn to save a rook," and even sacrifice a "rook" to protect the "king."
When Walterson, a financier in New York, was a bank clerk,
Once,
his boss asked him to prepare a set of documents as soon as possible.
The person who possessed this information was the general manager of a company.
So, Watson went to visit him.
When he was ushered into the general manager's office,
a young secretary peeked in from the door to tell the general manager that
She didn't have any stamps for her son today.
The general manager explained to Walterson:
"I am collecting stamps for my twelve-year-old son."
"After that,"
Walterson explained his purpose to the general manager,
and consulted him on some issues,
However,
from beginning to end, the general manager was vaguely and perfunctorily dealing with him,
He adopted an attitude that avoided discussing the issue altogether.
Consequently, the meeting ended quickly.
And it was entirely fruitless.
Watson later recalled:
"To be honest,"
I really didn't know what to do at the time.
Suddenly, I remembered what his secretary had said,
Something about stamps...
A twelve-year-old child,
At the same time, I also thought that our bank's international department is also collecting stamps.
Those stamps are from all over the world.
”
"The next afternoon,
I went to visit him directly.
After arriving,
I asked his secretary to give him a message,
telling him that I brought some stamps for his children.
So,
I received a warm welcome.
He shook my hand warmly.
As if he were running for Congress.
He greeted me with a smile and a radiant face.
He admired the stamps while,
saying:
'My George will definitely love this one,
Look at this! This is a treasure! We spent half an hour talking about stamps and his son
Afterwards, he spent a full hour providing me with the information I needed.
He told me everything he knew.
And he was even afraid of leaving something out.
He called in his subordinates to inquire about it
Even called me

Processing.
Haydn, known to the world as the "Father of Music,"
His life was always sustained by the salary he received as the Kapellmeister of the Esterházy princely court orchestra.
He led an orchestra of 30 musicians at the Duke's residence,
Living a relatively stable life.
Unexpectedly, one day,
the Duke suddenly decided to dismiss these 30 musicians.
The news spread,
and everyone looked at each other in dismay.
I don't know what to do.
Haydn couldn't think of a good way to get the Duke to withdraw his order either.
With a heavy heart, he wrote the "Farewell Symphony," preparing to give a farewell performance at the dismissal meeting.
During the performance,
The band started with a cheerful and bright major key tune,
playing a beautiful,
light,
and humorous melody,
Then it went from bright to dim,
and a feeling of sorrow and resentment gradually spread.
At this moment,
a violinist blew out the candle beside the music stand,
He put down his violin,
Nodded goodbye to the Duke, and then quietly left.
Then another musician left the stage in the same manner.
One after another, they departed in succession,
Only one candle remained in the hall,
flickering.
Haydn faced alone

Bowed deeply to the Duke,
Slowly retreated.
At this moment,
the Duke couldn't help but exclaim inexplicably:
'"Haydn! What on earth is going on?" Haydn replied calmly:'
"Your Grace,"
"These are the members of the orchestra bidding you farewell!" The Duke realized what was happening,
He said:
"Let me think about it again!" With that,
30 musicians were left behind once more.
Look,
How clever Haydn's means of analyzing and handling problems are.
4. Gratitude and Reciprocity
Gratitude and reciprocity is a balancing principle that transcends utilitarian desires.
One party selflessly bestows favor,
The other understands gratitude and seeks to repay it.
"We should repay a drop of kindness with a gushing spring,"
is a traditional virtue of the Chinese nation.
Cha Jipei, a Xiaolian (a civil service examination degree) from Haining,
was a man of great talent.
Possessing an elegant demeanor.
At the end of a certain year,
It was snowing heavily,
Cha Jipei found it boring to drink alone,
I then casually stepped out,
intending to find a good companion to appreciate the snow scene.
Scene.
Suddenly, I saw a beggar sheltering from the snow under the eaves of his veranda.
The beggar was tall and sturdy,
Standing upright in the cold wind.
Zha Jipei felt that this person was no ordinary beggar,
And he had also heard of a person in the market called "Iron Beggar,"
Stepping forward to ask,
it was indeed him, so he invited "Iron Beggar" into the house,
The two drank together.
"Iron Beggar" had a surprisingly large alcohol capacity,
After drinking thirty rounds, he still showed no signs of drunkenness.
He ended up getting Zha Jipei drunk instead.
Zha Jipei collapsed drunk on the bed.
But "Iron Beggar" slept under the eaves of the corridor
A night.
The next day,
Zha Jipei
Chapter Two, Section Two:
Qing asked about the internal logical relationship of Ni 45
After waking up from the alcohol,
Remembering that "Iron Beggar" was poorly dressed and had difficulty keeping warm,
he asked his servant to send his cotton robe to him
"“Iron Beggar” took the cotton robe and left,"
Without even coming in to express his thanks.
The following year,
Zha Jipei was living in Changming Temple in Hangzhou,
While visiting West Lake, I suddenly saw "Iron Beggar" barefoot and bare-armed,
walking alone with his head held high.
So I took him back to the temple,
and asked where his cotton robe had gone,
'"Iron Beggar" said it was late spring and he didn't need it,'
'so he took it to exchange for wine.'
Cha Jipei admired his straightforwardness very much,
and asked him if he had read any books.
'"Iron Beggar" said he hadn't studied,'
'Knowing how to read wouldn't have led to him becoming a beggar. Hearing this,'
Cha Jipei was deeply moved,
and hurriedly asked his name and ancestral home.
Tie Gai said his family had lived in Guangdong for generations.
His surname was Wu, and his given name was Liuqi.
He lost his father and brothers when he was young.
He was naturally fond of gambling
Leading to a life of wandering and destitution.
However, being a beggar is not a base profession.
Even ancient sages were not immune to it.
To be appreciated by you today is a great honor.
Thank you very much.
Although I am not a Zhang Liang-like figure,
I still dare not forget the kindness of a single meal.
Zha Jipei grabbed Wu Liuqi's arm,
Says:
"You are truly an outstanding talent in the country,
but I only saw you as a drinking buddy,
I was truly blind."
"The two men cherished each other's talent,"
and drank heartily together.
Zha Jipei gifted Wu Liuqi with a lot of money and goods,
and sent him back to Guangdong.
Wu Liuqi had lived in Chaozhou for a long time,
and had wandered around,
so he was extremely familiar with the passes, rivers, and roads of the South.
At that time, the Qing soldiers had just entered the South,
There is an urgent need for talents in this area.
One day, Wu Liuqi was captured by Qing soldiers on patrol.
Wu Liuqi requested to see the commander.
He described the geographical situation of Guangdong to the commander in detail.
Then, he asked the commander-in-chief for permission to go and persuade them to surrender.
The commander-in-chief followed his auspicious advice and proceeded,
and finally pacified Guangdong.
Later, during the campaign to suppress Shu,
Wu Liuqi repeatedly made extraordinary achievements,
In a few years,
He was promoted to the provincial admiral of both land and water forces.
Wu Liuqi's success was inseparable from Zha Jipei's material support and spiritual encouragement.
Wu Liuqi also did not forget Bian Jipei, who gave him a robe in the past.
giving him gold,
and the words "Outstanding Talent of the World."
In the early years of the Kangxi Emperor,
Wu Liuqi sent his general to deliver three thousand gold pieces to Zha Jipei,
and invited Zha Jipei to Guangdong.
When Zha Jipei arrived at Meiling,
Wu Liuqi's son personally greeted him on the side of the road.
They were extremely respectful in their etiquette.
Twenty li away from the prefecture and county,
Wu Liuqi is here waiting respectfully,
Paving the way with eight horses,
More than a thousand soldiers followed behind him,
The reception and etiquette were no different from those accorded to princes and nobles.
After Wu Liuqi welcomed Cha Jipei into his residence,
He prostrated himself on the ground.
He claims to be the Iron Beggar of yesteryear.
If I hadn't met you, sir, how could I be where I am today? Even with my current position,
it is still not enough to repay your kindness and virtue.
Zha Jipei lived in Wu Liuqi's mansion for a year.
Whatever he requested,
Wu Liuqi always listened and obeyed.
When Cha Jipei went home,
Wu Liuqi also gave him three thousand gold pieces
and said:
"I dare not speak of repayment,
but merely use this to express the gratitude of a young man from Huaiyin (comparing himself to Zhang Liang)."
"
When Cha Jipei was in Wu Liuqi's residence,
Seeing a stone peak imported from England in its garden,
46- Nine aspects of being good at analyzing problems
Exquisitely unique,
Made by nature,
Highly appreciated.
So, the inscription became the two characters 'Zhou Yun' (Crepe Cloud).
After checking the stone again half a month later,
it suddenly disappeared.
Shi Tou was sent back to Zha Jipei's hometown by Wu Liuqi's men using a large boat.
They had to cross mountains and rivers along the way.
I don't know how much silver it will cost.
This shows how deeply Wu Liuqi cares for Zha Jipei.
II.
Analyzing problems should be approached with an equal perspective
Analyzing problems is like walking on a balance beam.
Once you lose your balance,
May fall to the ground.
Therefore,
We must have an equal concept when analyzing problems,
Adhere to the principle of equality,
Strive to ensure that each party involved in the problem or conflict gains a certain degree of respect and psychological balance.
It should be understood that a problem may involve people or relationships from various aspects.
Each party may be unyielding to each other in the problem.
Argue Reasonably.
Even if it's unreasonable, they will try to make trouble,
Attempting to gain some advantages.
In this situation,
The person solving the problem should not be sentimental,
Avoid bias and favoritism.
Treat everyone equally.
Strive for impartiality and fairness.
Ensure that everyone is respected.
Being cared for.
The so-called equality,
mainly refers to equality in personality,
fairness in method and uniformity in standards.
1. Equality in personality
A country has its national character,
and a person has their personality.
Inequality in personality,
is the most intolerable.
Therefore,
When we analyze problems,
we must first consider equality in personality.
One day in the early days of liberation,
Mayor Chen Gou went to a textile mill.
He said with a smile:
"Boss,
I apologize for intruding,
Are visitors welcome?
This boss is troubled by something,
and started complaining:
"Mayor Chen,"
Today, the union came again to ask me to abolish the 'body search system.' It's easy to criticize when you're not the one managing things.
Workers are body-searched after work,
and yarn is often lost.
If the body search system is abolished,
The yarn factory would be completely stolen!
Chen Ban took a sip of tea,
and said slowly:
"If we're talking about running a factory,"
or buying machinery,
I'd like to take you as my teacher.
Because I've only ever been a worker.
Haven't run a factory before! When it comes to managing workers,

Please speak quickly.

is that? The boss treats the workers as only
A tool that can talk,
Labor is very
heavy,
Wages are very low,
The workers really
couldn't make ends meet,
The factory made
money but it didn't benefit the workers at all,
Why don't they take it? Now
It's different now! Workers have become masters of their own destiny.
They understand that only by doing a good job in production and management
can the new China become prosperous and strong
Workers can improve their treatment.
Although you are private enterprises,
you are also a component of the New Democratic economy,
and you can also benefit the country.
Benefits the people.
Therefore,
In my opinion,
you should take the lead in the textile industry,
Try it my way.
Abolish the practice of body searching.
Care about the interests of workers.
Treat workers like friends.
Like brothers,
consult with them more when they have difficulties,
I believe the current difficulties will be overcome.
”
The manager nodded repeatedly after listening:
"Thinking about it, there's some truth to that."
"The next day,"
he took the initiative to consult with the labor union,
and decided to abolish the body search system.
Comrade Chen Yi's words
led to the abolition of the "body search system," which capitalists revered.
The body search system was an unreasonable regulation imposed on workers by private industrial and commercial enterprises before liberation.

Good dreams,
Arriving in Zhuhai,
I didn't expect to be insulted like this.
At this moment, they were weeping with tears,
A chorus of crying...
…
What a shameful scene this is!
More than 120 Chinese workers jumped down and,
knelt on the hard floor,
kneeling before the Korean female boss.
However, what is encouraging is:
Right in the dark crowd jumping down,
A young man stood stubbornly.
He questioned Jin Zhenren loudly:
'"Why should I kneel?" He shouted at his compatriots, "Are you Chinese?" Jin Zhenxian was enraged,'
She didn't expect anyone to dare to "offend" her.
She roared at the top of her lungs:
"Scoundrel!" This young man did not yield.
He kicked the stool away in a rage,
tore off the factory badge hanging on his chest,
and strode out of the workshop.
After the news came out,
The public was in uproar.
While people were righteously denouncing Jin Zhenxian,
they did not forget the only young man who refused to kneel down.
His name was Sun Tianshuai.
He is from Wanghe Village, Xiaolin Town, Dengzhou City, Henan Province.
He is 24 years old this year. When asked why he could do this, he replied:
"At that time,"
I didn't think about anything.
I just can't kneel down to her.
I am Chinese,
I would rather die than kneel!"
In this regard,
During a lecture to Peking University students, the renowned writer Liang Xiaosheng
said with emotion:
"Chinese youth should all be like Sun Tianshuai,
stand up straight,"
Don't lie down!
Sun Tianshuai is not insulted because
He has a principle of equality in his heart,
The Korean female boss is a human being,
Wage earners are also human beings.
People are equal.
There is no distinction between high and low, noble and humble among people.
There is only a difference in the division of labor in society.
Hitting, scolding, corporal punishment, and humiliation,
These are illegal things.
If you don't accept appeals and petitions,
the other party will not apologize to you or accept punishment.
Only by appealing and petitioning,
Seeking support from higher-level leaders or exposure from news media,
can the other party be forced to admit their mistake.
A female employee of Shanghai KFC named Jin Yingjie,
Being "ordered" by the boss to enter the cold storage and "stand for 10 minutes" is a serious personal abuse.
The female employee asked the manager for an explanation,
But the manager refused to admit his mistake.
Later,
She complained about the matter to a local newspaper.
This is what she wrote in the letter:
November 19, 1996,
I was on a single-shift duty as an apprentice with the manager,
Discovered a shortage of "materials" in the refrigerator,
Immediately asked the early shift kitchen staff to move a certain amount from the freezer
50 Nine aspects of grasping and analyzing problems
of cut-up chicken and leg meat to thaw.
Due to the continuous shortage of materials for several days,
it happened during the afternoon peak hours.
The supply was cut off.
Restaurant manager Fan discovered the stockout in the kitchen,
Very angry,
He called me into the kitchen.
He didn't even bother to find out why we were out of stock,
Nor did he ask if I had taken any measures.
and loudly scolded me.
I didn't have time to explain,
he interrupted me,
and raised his hand, saying:
"Stop talking,"
Stop talking,
Go stand in the cold storage for 10 minutes and then come out.
"I stood still,"
'A stalemate lasted for a few seconds.'
'In front of all the kitchen staff, Fan repeated the previous'
'command" unequivocally…'
…
'The temperature inside the cold storage was around 1℃ at the time.'
I stood inside,
Wearing only a long-sleeved shirt...
…
About seven or eight minutes passed,
The door to the cold storage room opened,
They pulled me out...
…
After what happened that day,
I caught a fever the next day,
Because I happened to have my period that day,
I got a period pain I've never had before after catching a cold...
…
…
After the reporter's interview,
the restaurant manager finally admitted his mistake,
and the matter was resolved.
From the above two examples,
Bosses or managers rely on their authority,
When facing problems,
They lose their rationality,
Seriously violates the principle of equality of personality.
In the end, you'll only end up lifting a rock to drop it on your own feet.
2. The method should be fair.
Many problems arise in life.
At its root,
most of it comes from inequality.
Therefore,
there has been a saying since ancient times that "when there is injustice, there will be a cry."
Because the root cause of the problem stems from inequality,
the analysis of the problem should start from the principle of equality,
to make inequality achieve equality or basic equality,
so that the problem can be properly handled.
Chapter Two, Aspect Two:
Understanding the Internal Logic of the Problem
The so-called principle of equality,
In addition to the personal equality mentioned earlier,
Fairness should also be emphasized in the way problems are handled.
So what is a fair method?
You can influence the other party with your own impartial attitude.
If the other party feels that your attitude towards them is fair,
It's impossible not to take it seriously.
A fair attitude is generally manifested in treating oneself rationally,
understanding the other party objectively,
and being not arbitrary.
Not being extremist.
People standing at a crossroads looking around,
generally are in urgent need of help from others.
It's appropriate to offer some guidance to them.
Tianjin.
Anyone can feel lost when faced with major choices,
confused.
So don't act on impulse when helping others solve problems,
'Be sure to rationally consider all the possibilities of the problem.'
Sincerely help the other party find a comprehensive solution.
It can combine emotion and reason.
No problem is generated by oneself.
It's either in emotion,
Or in reason.
When analyzing problems,
As long as it is reasonable and rational,
The goal of communication is not difficult to achieve.
If you are a third-party intervener,
facing the conflict between Party A and Party B,
you should be impartial,
Uphold fairness,
Pay attention to techniques,
And strive to achieve a better resolution to the problem.
Mediators can create conditions for opposing parties to talk at the table.
To get both parties to sit down and discuss the issues in dispute.
To create a constructive negotiating environment.
It includes:
Maintaining civil debate rules,
As an impartial discussion facilitator,

Calm unreasonable demands and relax promises.
In this way,

Mediators can devise new solutions,
Encourage disputants to be more creative in seeking solutions.

Wang Jun and Zhong Ming were hired by a supermarket at about the same time.
Everyone started from the bottom at the beginning.
But soon Wang Jun was favored by the general manager,
Repeatedly promoted,
From foreman to department manager,
Zhong Ming, however, seemed to have been forgotten,
Still stuck at the very bottom.
Finally, one day, Zhong Ming couldn't bear it any longer,
and submitted his resignation to the general manager,
and angrily rebuked the general manager for not recognizing talent,
and not promoting those who work diligently
Promote those who are good at flattering and boasting.
The general manager listened patiently;
He
Understand this young man,
Willing to work hard,
But it seems to be missing something. What's missing? It's hard to explain in a few words.
He won't accept it even if I tell him.
It seems..
…
He suddenly had an idea.
"Zhong Ming," the general manager said,
"Go to the market right away,
and see what's for sale today."
"
Zhong Ming quickly returned from the market and said,
There was only one farmer pulling a cart of potatoes at the market just now.
Chapter 2, Aspect 2:
Clarify the internal logical relationships of the problem 53
On sale.
"How many bags are there in a truck,
how many pounds?" the general manager asked.
Zhong Ming ran off again,
He said there were 40 bags when he got back.
"What's the price?" Zhong Ming ran to the market again.
The general manager looked at him, panting, and said:
"Please take a break,
Let's see how Wang Jun does it.
"After saying that, he called Wang Jun over and said to him:"
"Mr. Wang Jun,
Go to the market immediately,
Let's see what's for sale today.
”
Wang Jun quickly returned from the market,
reporting that so far only one farmer is selling potatoes,
there are 40 bags.
The price is moderate.
The quality is very good.
He brought back a few to show the general manager.
This farmer will also bring several boxes of tomatoes to the market later.
According to him, the price is fair,
so he can stock up on some goods.
Tomatoes at this price would probably be wanted by the general manager,
so he not only brought back a few tomatoes as samples,
And he also brought that farmer along.
He's waiting outside for a response now.
The general manager looked at the blushing Zhong Ming,
and said earnestly:
"Promotions depend on ability."
But for now,
You still need to learn for a while,
See how others are doing it.
”
When dealing with Zhong Ming's resignation, the general manager
didn't offer much explanation.
He adopted a strategy of having them work on the same task,
to compare their efficiency
Make Zhong Ming feel inadequate and speechless in the face of the facts.
In the Southern Dynasty, there was a famous calligrapher and painter named Wang Sengdu.
He was a fourth-generation descendant of Wang Xizhi of the Jin Dynasty.
His running script,
Regular script inherited the sacrificial methods,
achieving profound attainments.
His clerical script was also as flowing and graceful as floating clouds and flowing water.
Emperor Qi Gao Di Xiao Daocheng of the current dynasty was also a master of calligraphy.
Moreover, he considered himself extraordinary.
He didn't like hearing others say his calligraphy was inferior to his subjects.
As a result, Wang Sengqian felt very restrained.
He dared not reveal his talent.
One day,
Emperor Qi Gao, Xiao Daocheng, proposed a calligraphy competition with Wang Sengqian.
So the monarch and his minister both carefully finished a piece of calligraphy.
After finishing writing,
Emperor Qi Gao, Xiao Daocheng, asked Wang Sengqian with arrogance:
"Tell me,"
Who is number one,
Who is number two?
If it were a common subject,
of course, he would immediately answer:
"Your Majesty is first" or "Your subject is inferior."
Wang Sengqian was unwilling to demean himself.
Clearly, his calligraphy was superior to the emperor's,
why would he give an insincere
54- Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
answer? But he didn't dare offend the emperor,
What to do? Wang Sengpi's eyes rolled,
Surprisingly, he uttered a wonderful answer that has been passed down through the ages:
"A giant book,"
I am the first among subjects;
His Majesty's calligraphy,
The Emperor is number one.
He cleverly divided the calligraphy competition between ministers and the emperor into two groups,
'namely, the "Minister Group" and the "Emperor Group," and evaluated them.'
He not only flattered the emperor by putting a high hat on him,
saying that his calligraphy was "the best among emperors," satisfying the emperor's desire to be a champion,
but also maintained his own honor and integrity,
making Emperor Quan even more respectful of his moral integrity
I don't think he's the type to be a brown-noser.
As expected,
Emperor Qi Gao, Xiao Daocheng, heard this and
laughed heartily,
They stopped arguing about who was number one.
Wang Sengqian's analysis of the problem is brilliant because of his fair approach:
The ministers are one group,
The emperor is one group.
The conclusion is:
"Giant Book,
The first among subjects;
Your Majesty's book,
The best among emperors.

A couple has been married for over ten years.
Every month, they have to send living expenses to both sets of parents.
This matter has always been handled by Yaozi.
But the wife sent 50 yuan to her parents every month,
And 20 yuan to the husband's parents.
The husband was always angry in his heart,
But he didn't want to offend his precious son because of this.
Previously,
Every day after work, my husband
would do nothing,
and would always hug our youngest son first
He caressed her for a long time.
But when he got home that day,
He saw his one-and-a-half-year-old son crying in the stroller,
But he pretended not to see anything,
Didn't hear anything.
He uncharacteristically walked to his five-year-old daughter's side,
and reached out to pick up his five-year-old daughter.
His wife, who was cooking, turned her head and saw this.
Hurriedly shouted:
"Your son is crying like that,
why aren't you going to哄 him?"
The husband said slowly:
"Here's 20 yuan,"
You should hold this! I want to hold 50 yuan.
"
The wife blushed when she heard this.
From then on, she also sent 50 yuan to her husband's parents every month.
On the issue of sending living expenses to both sets of parents,
in principle, there should be equal treatment.
However, the wife has taken unequal measures.
In order to correct the wife's mistake,
The clever husband humorously but principledly invited his wife into his pre-arranged

The "trap" of transposition, without tedious and lengthy complaining,
but with implied meaning, hinted at the essence of the matter and his own dissatisfaction.
Thus, it skillfully enhances one's speaking image.
This is a kind of overcorrection,
A method of seeking correctness through biased approaches.
It can be said to have a unique charm,
Be original and innovative.
There is also a true story that happened in a shopping mall:
"Hi,"
Cotton underwear,
"$4 apiece!" a man's cry,
Attracted a young woman to pick one from his stall.
She paid
the money,
Turning to leave,
the man hurriedly stopped him and said,
"Hey,
Still short 6 yuan."
The young woman was very puzzled:
"It's 4 yuan each,
I only took one,
Didn't I already give you 4 yuan!"
The man smiled slyly:
"Where would I say that?
I said 10 yuan per item."
The young woman said angrily:
"I clearly heard it was 4 yuan,"
Now you're saying it's 10 yuan,
"Isn't this deliberate deception?" The man glared fiercely and roared:
"Who deceived you? I called out 10 yuan!" The young woman was a little frightened,
saying timidly:
"10 yuan? Then I don't want it,"
Give me a refund.
"Then the man became even more outrageous,"
Pointing at the young woman aggressively:
"You want to mess with me? I haven't even opened for business today,
and you want to bring me bad luck? No way! Quickly give me another 6 yuan!" That expression,
seemed like he wanted to swallow the young woman whole.
Unexpectedly, she burst out laughing:
"Who are you trying to scare? Take a look at it yourself.
This kind of cotton undershirt,
is it worth 10 yuan? I'll give you 4 yuan."
You've already been given preferential treatment.
”
"I asked for 10 yuan,
why did you give me 4 yuan?"
"I heard you call out for 4 yuan."
Based on the current market conditions,
At most,
That's about the price.
”

"I clearly said 10 yuan."
You misheard it yourself.
Who can you blame?

"'4' and '10' have obvious differences in sound."
If you intend to deliberately blackmail customers,
deliberately confusing certain similarities in their pronunciation,
even if you gain a little advantage,
you can only succeed for a short time,
In the end, you're the one who loses.
It's still yourself.

"Who got extorted? Whether I'm at a loss or not,
what's it to you?"
"Oh my,"
Aren't you in business for the money? If you want to make money,
At the very least,
You have to have a reputation.
To insist on saying '4°' is '10°,' isn't that extortion? Disregarding your reputation,
How can you continue to do business? Even if I give you 10 yuan today,
Can you still extort a second person?

I shouted it,
It's 10...

"Now, whether you're calling it '4' or '10', both buyers and sellers in the market are pricing based on quality."
For this kind of thermal underwear,
if you ask for 10 yuan,
I would never buy it.
It can be said that,
No one would buy it.
On this point,
you are clearer than I am.

"Really…"

really,
I'm calling for...
…
10 yuan,
You didn't bargain,
Which means you agree.
What price did I call out?
"Okay,"
Even if you called out 10 yuan.
I'll pay you 4 yuan,
That means I think it's only worth that much.
Isn't this a concrete,
substantial counter-offer? Is there any need for more talk? If you don't think it's worth it,
you don't have to sell it
Similarly,
If you insist on 10 yuan,
I can also choose not to buy it.
This is the basic principle of market transactions.
Forced buying and selling,
are illegal.
If you want to go to the Industry and Commerce Bureau,
I'll go with you!

III.
Do you know the ancient saying "too much is as bad as too little"?
When analyzing the internal relationships of problems,
people should grasp the principle of moderation.
What is moderation? Moderation is a limit.
Limits,
Are about knowing where to draw the line,
And controlling the heat.
This means that,
The means used to analyze problems should be appropriate.
It shouldn't be insufficient to meet the requirements,
nor should it be excessive.
"\"Don't draw from a deep well with a short rope,\" and \"going too far is as bad as not going far enough\" illustrate this principle."
1. Appropriate measures
When people analyze problems,
they often take corresponding measures based on the development of the situation and the purpose of analyzing the problem.
This measure must be applied appropriately,
To achieve satisfactory results.
After the Sino-Indian Border Self-Defense Counterattack War began in 1962,
By November 19th and 20th,
Chinese border troops had achieved significant victories in both the eastern and western sectors.
At this time,
The situation is very favorable for the Chinese counterattack forces.
Whereas the Indian side is in a very unfavorable situation.
The Indian army has no defenses to rely on.
Nothing to depend on
There are not many soldiers to spare.
International military experts generally believe that
If the Chinese army continues to advance,
Based on the strength and combat power of the Indian army,
Even if two or three more divisions are deployed,
it will not be possible to reverse the defeat.
International public opinion generally believes that the Chinese army will definitely pursue the victory
and expand the gains.
However,
No one expected that Mao Zedong and the Chinese government would make a decision that was surprising at the time,
and still makes people ponder—
On November 20th at 18:00, the Chinese government made a decision to have the Chinese border troops cease fire and withdraw across the board,
and announced it to the world at 0:00 on the 21st
According to the decision of the Chinese government,
The General Staff Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued the "Order to Cease Counterattack Operations" on November 21. According to this order, the Chinese border troops,
starting from 00:00 on November 22,
took the initiative to,
Unilaterally cease fire along the entire Sino-Indian border,
And begin to withdraw on December 1.
By March 1, 1963,
The Chinese border troops had all withdrawn to within 20 kilometers of the line of actual control on November 7, 1959.
After the Chinese government announced a full ceasefire when the situation was extremely favorable for the Chinese army
Chapter Two, Aspect Two:
Clarify the internal logical relationships of the problem 59
Withdraw,
This was indeed far beyond the expectations of the Indian government,
and also completely beyond the expectations of many politicians,
military strategists, and international public opinion in the world.
Why did the victorious army find itself in a very advantageous situation,
When it was entirely possible to achieve greater victories,
Why unilaterally cease fire and voluntarily retreat? Indian politicians regarding this action by the Chinese government,
The Indian political circles,
and military personnel were surprised.
The international community is perplexed,
even now people may not be able to fully understand it.
Actually,
The problem is not difficult to understand,
and the answer is not complicated.
Once you understand Mao Zedong and the Chinese government's consistent position on the Sino-Indian border issue,
Once you understand the strategic intentions of the Chinese border troops in carrying out the self-defense counterattack operation,
The answer to this question becomes obvious.
The Chinese government has consistently adhered to negotiations in the international arena,
To resolve international border disputes peacefully,
We have consistently advocated this position on the Sino-Indian border issue.
Mao Zedong and the CPC Central Committee decided that the Chinese border troops should launch a self-defense counterattack against India.
Its intention was merely to give the aggressors a profound lesson.
To create conditions for the peaceful resolution of border issues,
It does not want to seek to change the border situation by force.
In short,
The purpose of fighting is to achieve peace.
Therefore,
After Mao Zedong taught the Indian army a lesson with the Chinese border troops,
he decisively decided to unilaterally cease fire and withdraw.
This action by the Chinese government
is unprecedented in the history of world warfare.
It is precisely because of this that
it further demonstrates Mao Zedong and the Chinese government's sincerity in seeking peace.
This action by the Chinese government
is a move that
Indicates the Chinese government's consistent position of resolving the Sino-Indian border dispute through peaceful negotiations.
It's not just lip service.
不
It's not to win public opinion.
And it is certainly not a 'deception' as the Indian government says.
This move by the Chinese government,
It also cleverly shows the world who is the aggressor and
who is the victim of aggression.
在
Grasping the nine aspects of analyzing problems
Prior to this,
India always uses its repeated failures in border skirmishes,
to portray itself as a victim,
and create public opinion that China will "invade on a large scale": Western public opinion, starting from its hostile stance towards China,
attacks China for wanting to seize Indian territory through war.
As soon as the Chinese government issued its statement,
Chinese border troops immediately ceased fire and withdrew,
and retreated to 20 kilometers behind the original Line of Actual Control.
The original slanders and false accusations were thus refuted by the irrefutable facts.
In a statement on the 21st, the Chinese government called on the Indian government to cease fire in China.
After taking the initiative to withdraw,
change course,
Take corresponding measures
Abandon the policy of aggression,
Return to the correct path of China-India friendship,
And peacefully resolving the border issue.
The Chinese government's statement also said,
Even if the Indian government cannot respond in a timely manner,
The Chinese government will proactively implement the ceasefire and withdrawal measures according to the stipulated date.
This is extremely magnanimous,
And extremely unrestrained.
Of course, Mao Zedong also considered another possibility.
To prevent the Indian army from taking advantage of the unilateral ceasefire by the Chinese border troops:
and their retreat,
to stage a comeback.
The Chinese government then issued a stern statement:
If the Indian troops continue to attack after the Chinese border defense forces cease fire and withdraw;
If the Indian troops withdraw 20 kilometers along the entire Line of Actual Control after the Chinese border defense forces withdraw 20 kilometers,
and re-advance to the Line of Actual Control in the eastern sector,
that is, the illegal McMahon Line,
continues to remain along the Line of Actual Control in the central and western sections without withdrawing;
if the Chinese border troops withdraw 20 kilometers along the entire Line of Actual Control,
the Indian army crosses the Line of Actual Control,
Restore it to its position before September 8,
China will retain the right to carry out self-defense counterattacks,
All serious consequences arising therefrom must be borne by the Indian government.
Although India is concerned about face-saving,
There was no response to the Chinese government's statement,
But in reality, the Indian army still ceased fire,
And avoided further provocations against China,
Avoiding confrontation with Chinese troops
Chapter Two, Aspect Two:
Clarify the internal logical relationship of the problem
Engagement.
The day after the Chinese government announced a ceasefire,
the Indian Ministry of Defence issued an order to its troops stationed on the Sino-Indian border:
If not attacked by the Chinese army,
they must not shoot at the Chinese army.
Then,
Indian Prime Minister Nehru entrusted Mrs. Bandaranaike, the Prime Minister of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), who came to China to mediate the Sino-Indian conflict, to secretly assure Premier Zhou Enlai that,
The Indian army does not plan to advance its troops to the forefront of the "McMahon Line" again.
In this way,
A large-scale armed conflict on the Sino-Indian border has effectively ceased.
Let's take a look back at a historical moment.
From February 21 to 28, 1972,
US President Nixon visited China,
opening the door to Sino-
US relations.
February 28th,
Middle,
The US and China issued a joint communiqué in Shanghai.
This was an important milestone in Sino-US relations.
After Nixon's party arrived in Beijing,
Met with Chairman Mao Zedong,
Attended the plenary session.
Subsequently,
The two sides discussed the communiqué to be issued at the end of Nixon's visit, line by line and word by word.
The communiqué is decisive,
because it lays the foundation for a new Sino-US relationship,
upon which all future diplomatic activities will be based.
Both sides focused on defining the scope of mutual understanding,
Clarify each other's positions.
Whether Chinese or American,
when dealing with real political issues,
neither are bound by legal provisions.
This makes the task more complex for both sides.
Diplomatic techniques are also complex,
President Nixon and Premier Zhou Enlai were the main interlocutors on major issues.
Then,
US Presidential National Security
Full advisor Kissinger and Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Qiao Guanhua worked hard to turn the reached understanding into the text of the communique.
This is a great example of contemporary flexible diplomacy.
One of the practices.
The talks among these four main figures in the negotiations,
Often, it lasts until late at night.
According to one aide,
neither side "feigned humility,
nor did they conceal their differences."
Although
Grasping the nine aspects of problem analysis
In previous talks with the Chinese side, Kissinger had already identified some general principles acceptable to both sides.
However, due to the long-term historical isolation between the United States and China,
Now we are encountering some things that are simply impossible to achieve
The specific differences that led to
In this case,
How could Kissinger and Qiao Guanhua draft a final communique?
Finally,
Premier Zhou Enlai and President Nixon came up with this idea,
to divide the communique into two parts,
one part reflecting the American point of view,
and the other part reflecting the Chinese point of view.
These are many creative solutions that have emerged in Beijing.
Nixon later said:
"This communique is very unique,
The uniqueness lies in faithfully presenting the differences,
Without using diplomatic rhetoric to cover it up.
"
At night,
Kissinger and Qiao Guanhua used this method to draft a joint communiqué acceptable to both sides,
until dawn.
On the issue of Vietnam,
The US side declared its support for the President's "eight-point proposal" of January 27, 1972, and the long-term goal of achieving self-determination for the people of Indochina;
The Chinese side declared its support for the ultimate goal of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam.
On the issue of Taiwan,
The United States will gradually reduce its armed forces and military installations in Taiwan as tensions in the Vietnam region ease.
China's completely clear statement leaves no room for compromise.
It leaves no legal or political loopholes.
And it absolutely makes clear that as long as the United States continues to recognize the Kuomintang regime,
China would not establish formal diplomatic relations with the United States.
The Taiwan issue is an "internal matter" in which the United States should not interfere.
Moreover,
The United States also promised to withdraw "all" of its troops and military installations from there.
In Nixon's official statement in the United States,
he did everything he could.
He effectively accepted a China,
and Taiwan is
Chapter Two, Aspect Two:
Clarifying the internal logical relationships of the problem 63
A concept of a part of China.
However, he refused to completely "abandon" Taiwan;
He promised to gradually withdraw US troops from Taiwan,
But he did not specify a deadline for the complete withdrawal.
The United States in public
In the communique, the United States did not deny the People's Republic of China's claim to Taiwan.
But not confirming it.
Most importantly,
The communique makes

the country to withdraw troops from Taiwan at a
speed connected to the end of the Vietnam War.
Together;
The United States will gradually withdraw its armed forces as tensions in the region ease (meaning as the Vietnam War ends).
This is subtly telling the Chinese that,
The Vietnam War is coming to an end,
The United States will increasingly close its military facilities in Taiwan.
Both China and the United States are taking appropriate measures to analyze the issues.
Diplomatic scholars readily admit that
The Shanghai Communiqué is a masterpiece in the history of diplomacy.
2. Moderate language
There's a saying,
which goes, "A wise person doesn't need to be told everything in detail,
and a loud drum doesn't need a heavy mallet."
Its meaning is:
A word to the wise is enough.
It is not necessary to say too much.
Nor do the words need to be too harsh.
We call this approach language moderation.
Zhang Yong, who was in charge of Yizhou during the Song Dynasty,
heard that Kou Zhun had become the Prime Minister,
and said to his subordinates:
"Kou Zhun was a remarkable talent,"

"Zhang Yong and Kou Zhun were close friends for many years,"
Therefore,
He was

I want to find an opportunity to persuade my old friend to read more books,
because as prime minister,
it concerns the rise and fall of the world,
Ought to have learned more.
It just so happened that not long after,
Kou Zhun came to Shaanxi on business,
Zhang Yong, who had just been relieved of his post, also came from Chengdu.
Arrived here.
Old friends meet,
Especially happy,
Kou Zhun prepared a hearty reception.
When parting ways in the suburbs,
Kou Zhun asked Zhang Yong:
"What can you teach me?" Zhang Yong had already considered this,
and was planning to take the opportunity to advise Lord Kou to read more.
But then I thought about it again,
Kou Zhun was already a dignified prime minister,
Second to one,
Above ten thousand,
How is it good?
How can I put it bluntly that he has no learning? Zhang Yong pondered slightly,
and said slowly:
"The Biography of Huo Guang must be read."
At the time, Kou Zhun couldn't understand what Zhang Yong meant by this,
but his old friend was unwilling to say another word about it,
and left after speaking.
Returning to the Prime Minister's residence,
Kou Zhun quickly found "The Book of Han · Biography of Huo Guang". He read it carefully from beginning to end.
When he read "Guang did not study and was unskilled,"
advised by Dali,
he suddenly understood
Muttering to himself:
"This Zhang Gong is talking about me!" Back then, Huo Guang held important positions such as Grand Marshal,
General-in-Chief, etc.,
and his position was equivalent to that of the Prime Minister in the Song Dynasty
He assisted the Han Dynasty and made great contributions,
but he was arrogant because of his merits.
It's not good to learn from him.
He is unreasonable.
This has some similarities with Kou Zhun.
Therefore, after reading "Biography of Huo Guang," Kou Zhun quickly understood Zhang Yong's intention,
and felt he benefited a lot from it.
Kou Zhun was a famous politician of the Northern Song Dynasty.
He was firm, resolute, and upright.
He was quick-witted.
Zhang Yong praised him as a "rare talent" of the time.
As for "insufficient academic background," it means that Kou Zhun did not pay much attention to learning.
Has a narrow range of knowledge,
This will greatly limit Kou Zhun's ability to perform;
因
Chapter Two, Aspect Two:
Clarify the internal logical relationship of the problem
Thus,
Zhang Yong's intention to advise Kou Zhun to read more and deepen his knowledge was both objective and pertinent.
However,
It was too direct,
For Kou Zhun, who had just become the Prime Minister,
It wouldn't look good on the surface,
And it would also damage his image if it spread.
Zhang Yong knew that Kou Zhun was a smart man,
He then gave him the advice, "The Biography of Huo Guang is a must-read," to let him understand on his own.
Causing the criticism of "ignorant and incompetent," which even ordinary people find difficult to accept,
through the euphemistic method of teaching the Biography of Huo Guang,
the current prime minister happily accepted it.
So,
Zhang Gong's words and actions,
Can be described as extremely appropriate.
During the Korean War,
Commander of the Volunteer Army Peng Dehuai wrongly blamed General Hong Xuezhi because of a telegram.
I lost my temper with him.
Afterwards,
Peng Dehuai felt very sorry.
The next day, he saw Hong Xuezhi at breakfast,
He took Hong Xuezhi's hand and said:
"Look,
I wrongly blamed you yesterday,
I'm sorry!" Peng Dehuai saw pears on the table,
Then he picked up one and handed it to Hong Xuezhi,
and said with a smile,
"Eat a pear,
Eat a pear,
I'll compensate you with a pear (gift).
"This one sentence made both of them burst into laughter."
Peng Dehuai has always been admired for his straightforwardness,
and his open-mindedness.
Here,
He didn't act condescendingly just because he was the commander,
Arrogant,
But he was willing to correct his mistakes.
He first frankly admitted his mistake,
and then became sentimental upon seeing the object,
interpreting "pear" as a homophone for "courtesy" or "ritual."
Showing the demeanor of a great general,
Reached the point of compensation again.
Achieved the goal of apologizing.

conclude.
However,
Driven by self-esteem,
especially some leading cadres who have not yet correctly established the concept of equality between superiors and subordinates,
often feel that they do not need to apologize to their subordinates,
or find it difficult to say,
Felt it was a loss of face and status.
Peng Dehuai's position was undeniably high.
His "face" was undeniably significant.
Yet, he apologized twice for a wrongful accusation.
Whether directly or euphemistically,
It demonstrates the spirit of self-criticism that leading comrades should possess.
Mao Zedong once at home,
He heard that Zhang Gan, the principal of Hunan First Normal School, was still teaching.
He took the lead and said in a somewhat self-reproachful tone:
"Zhang Gan is a very capable person."
He is very good at speaking.
It's not easy to become the principal of the First Normal School in his 30s.
Before liberation, they ate chalk dust,
After liberation, they still ate chalk dust,
It's rare and blameworthy.
Looking back now, there wasn't much need to rush at the time.
'It cannot be blamed on him that each normal school student pays 10 yuan in tuition and miscellaneous fees.'
"
Mao Zedong's language was very moderate.
Towards his former rivals in irreconcilable struggles,
He was able to give such an objective and fair evaluation.
One can easily perceive a kind of outstanding courage in it,
and a broad-minded spirit.

Not only will the problem not be solved.
Chapter Three: Aspect Three:
Clear up external connections of the manuscript problem 71
But also a timely solution won't be reached.
Moreover, it will continue to victimize the parties entangled in the problem, suffering grievances.
Full of resentment,
Making justice not prevail,
And clarity not appear.
The principle of responsibility advocated here,
on the one hand, refers to having a sense of responsibility for problems and their consequences,
and having a sense of responsibility for others and their dignity;
on the other hand, it also refers to a person's willingness to take responsibility when faced with problems.
Become the mainstay in solving problems.
Sometimes,
Whether the person analyzing the problem can bear this responsibility
is the key to opening a breakthrough in the problem.
Sun Bin said:
"A general,"
cannot be without virtue,
without virtue, there is no power,
without power, the benefit of the three armies cannot be obtained.
Therefore, virtue is
the hand of the military.
"Not shifting blame after defeat"
is a noble virtue.
It's not terrible to lose a battle.
What's terrible is blaming each other, leading to low morale.
On the contrary,
if the commander can take the lead in shouldering their responsibilities,
And inspire the fighting spirit of subordinates,
Then there will be a situation of "a sudden turn for the better."
Failure has two completely opposite effects,
One is to cause a unit to fall apart,
First, it makes a unit more united.
The handling of responsibility for failure is an important factor in creating this huge difference.
During the Roman Empire,
A great civil war broke out between Caesar and Pompey for the supreme power.
In the Battle of Dyrrachium,
Caesar's army suffered a disastrous defeat,
and was almost completely annihilated.
The palace guards felt deeply humiliated by the defeat.
Fufan demanded that those who had fled first be punished.
However,
Caesar did not punish them,
but rebuked them with a waterfall-like attitude,
asking them to recover the losses in the next battle.
Washed away the humiliation with thunder.
Caesar believed that,
This operation failed,
mainly due to his own responsibility,
Because Dyrrhachium was Pompey's base,
Choosing such a combat objective
Allowed Pompey to occupy the opportune timing of the heavens,
Advantageous terrain,
Harmony among the people.
This is a strategic mistake,
and does not blame the soldiers in the army for fighting poorly.
Caesar didn't do that kind of "blaming others for his own mistakes."
The foolish act of "forcing others to take medicine,"
Consequently, it greatly boosted the courage of the soldiers,
And later quickly reversed the defeat.
The principle of taking responsibility,
In terms of method, there is a difference between daring to take responsibility and being good at taking responsibility.
In terms of content, there is taking responsibility for oneself,
taking responsibility for others,
and taking responsibility for the group.
Responsibility for national interests.
1. Dare to take responsibility
Dare to take responsibility,
Requires a spirit of adventure,
If not handled properly, you may be wronged
72 - Grasping the nine aspects of analyzing problems: disaster.
Cheng Lai fled in panic and reported to the Lord of Wu, saying:
'"Shu will not agree to peace talks,'
'Vowing to destroy Eastern Wu first,'
Then attack Wei.
The ministers earnestly advised against it, but he would not listen.
What should we do?
Quan was greatly shocked.
To act in a flustered manner.
Que Ze stepped forward from the ranks and reported:
"Now there is a pillar that holds up the sky,
Why not use it?" Quan urgently asked who it was.
Ze said:
"In the past, the important affairs of Eastern Wu
were entirely entrusted to Zhou Lang;
Later, Lu Zijing took his place;
After Zijing's death,
Decisions were made by Lü Ziming;
Now, although Ziming is dead,
Lu Boyan is currently in Jing Province.
Although this man is known as a Confucian scholar,
He actually possesses great talent and strategy.
In my opinion,
He is no less capable than Zhou Yu
Formerly, when Guan Yu broke through,
his plans all came from Boyan (Lu Xun).
If Your Majesty
can employ him,
The conquest of Shu is assured.
If, by any chance, we fail,
I am willing to share the punishment.
"Sun Quan said:"
"If it weren't for De Run's words,"
I would have almost ruined a major affair.
"Zhang Zhao said:"
"Lu Xun is just a scholar,"
Not an opponent of Liu Bei,
I'm afraid he's not suitable for the job.
”Gu Yong also said:
"Lu Xun is young and of low reputation,
I fear the other ministers will not be convinced.
If they are not convinced, it will cause trouble and chaos.
It will certainly ruin important matters.
The imperial carriage also said:
"He is only capable of governing a prefecture;"
If he is entrusted with important matters,
it is not suitable for him.
"Que Ze shouted loudly:"
"If Lu Boyan is not used,
then the Eastern Wu is finished! I am willing to guarantee him with my whole family!" Quan said:
"I have always known that Lu Boyan is a genius! My mind is made up,
you don't need to say anymore."
"Thereupon, he ordered Lu Xun to be summoned."
Later,
Lu Xun burned the continuous camps with fire,
Greatly defeated Liu Bei,
Turned the Eastern Wu kingdom from danger to safety.
This story fully demonstrates Kan Ze's sense of responsibility.
First, "If there is any loss,
I am willing to be punished with him."
"Seeing that many people were against it,"
he then exclaimed loudly:
'"If Lu Boyan is not employed,'
'then Eastern Wu is doomed! I am willing to guarantee it with my whole family!" What spirit this is!'
If Lu Xun were to really fail,
Kan Ze's entire family would be executed.
However,
for the sake of the country,
He's not afraid,
on major issues,
he dares to take responsibility.

Procrastination is not a responsible behavior.

What about nagging?

If a frontline commander encounters a situation where they feel "somewhat constrained,"
Should be reported.
During the Liberation War,
The Central Military Commission once instructed Su Yu to lead a force to cross the Yangtze River in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River,
To establish a base area in the border area of Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangxi to threaten Nanjing,
Pin down the enemy in Jiangnan.
After Cheng Yu received the order,
he conducted a detailed analysis and
concluded that after a long journey,
Advance after shifting the battlefield,
After reaching the destination,
The remaining troops will not be enough to threaten Nanjing,
or contain the enemy.
It would be more advantageous to keep these tens of thousands of troops in place to annihilate the enemy rather than to retreat.
So Su Yu submitted a proposal to the Military Commission,
requesting to be relieved of this task.
The most valuable lesson that this strategic thinking offers to modern commanders is that,
One should understand that the battlefield situation is constantly changing.
It is important to avoid being unaware of changes,
and rigidly,
mechanically executing orders.
Su Yu's performance in this matter
was not only about daring to take responsibility,
but also about being good at taking responsibility.
74 Nine aspects of cover analysis and interesting questions
In the story of Lü Ziming's "crossing the river in white robes,"
there is a passage that focuses solely on Lu Xun.
Lü Meng resigned from Sun Quan and
returned to Lukou.
A scout reported:
"Along the river, both up and down,"
either twenty li,
or thirty li,
Each department in the senior years division has its own beacon tower.
"Also, I heard that the Jingzhou army is well-organized and prepared,"
being prepared in advance,
The family head was shocked and said:
"If that's the case,"
This is a desperate situation.
I persuaded Wu Hou to take Jingzhou at that time,
"But how should I deal with it now?" He pondered without a plan,
He feigned illness and refused to come out,
and sent someone to report back to Sun Quan.
When Quan heard that Lü Meng was seriously ill,
he was very happy.
Lu Xun stepped forward and said,
"Lu Ziming's illness,
is just a pretense,
it's not a real illness." Quan said,
"Bo Yan already knows it's a trick,"
You can go and see it.
"Lu Xun accepted the order,"
and arrived at the Lukou camp that night.
He went to see Lü Meng,
and indeed, his face showed no sign of illness.
Xun said,
"I am acting on the orders of Marquis Wu,
Respectfully inquire after Ziming's well-being, as requested by General. Ce said:
"My humble self is occasionally ill,"
Why trouble yourself to inquire?
"Xun said:"
"The Marquis of Wu entrusted you with a great responsibility,"
Why don't you seize the opportunity to act,
But instead hold onto your frustration in vain?
Meng Guo looked at Lu Xun,
Remained silent for a long time.
Xun then said:
"I have a small remedy,
able to cure the General's illness,"
'"Is it possible to know?" Meng then dismissed those around him and asked:'
'"Boyan has a good remedy,
Please teach me early!" Xun smiled and said:'
'"Ziming\'s phlegm,'
However, because the Jingzhou army is well-organized,
there are beacon towers prepared along the river.
I have a plan,
to order the guards along the river,
No open flames allowed.
The soldiers of Jing Province,
came to surrender,
'"Is that acceptable?" Lü Meng was startled and thanked him, saying:'
"Bo Yan's words,"
are like seeing into my heart.
I wish to hear a good plan,
'"Lu Xun said:'
"Yun Chang relies on his heroic spirit,"
and believes himself to be invincible.
The only one he worries about is you, General.
General, take this opportunity,
Resigned on the pretext of illness,
And let someone else take over the position of Lukou,
Have someone else flatter Guan Gong when drunk,
To inflate his pride
He will definitely withdraw the Jingzhou troops
to face Fancheng.
If Jingzhou is unprepared,
we can use a small force
Do not use extraordinary plans to attack it,
then Jingzhou will be in our grasp.
"Meng was overjoyed and said:"
"This is a truly excellent plan!"
Consequently, Lü Meng fell ill and was unable to rise.
He submitted a memorial requesting to resign from his position.
Lu Xun then met with Sun Quan.
He fully explained the previous plan.
Sun Quan then summoned Lü Meng back to Jianye to recuperate.
When Meng arrived,
he went to see Quan.
Quan asked him:
"The responsibility at Lukou,"
In the past, Zhou Gongjin recommended Lu Zijing to replace himself,
Later, Zijing also recommended you to replace him;
Now, you also need to recommend someone with both talent and prestige,
"It would be best to have someone replace you." Meng said:
"If you use someone highly respected,
Yun Chang will definitely be on guard.
Lu Xun's meaning is profound,
and had no widespread reputation,
was not feared by Yun Chang;
if he were to be used to replace me,
he would surely accomplish something." Quan was overjoyed,
Immediately, Lu Xun was appointed as a Lieutenant General and
Right Commander-in-Chief,
replacing Meng to guard Lukou.
Xun declined, saying:
"I am young and unlearned,"
I fear I am unequal to the heavy task.
"Quan said:"
"Ziming vouches for you,"
There must be no mistakes.
You must not decline.
"Xun then accepted the seal of authority,"
And went to Lukou overnight;
The handover of the troops of the three armies was completed,
and a letter was written immediately,
signed by Ma,
Yijin,
Gifts of wine and ritual items, etc.,
He sent an envoy with expenses to Jiangcheng to see Guan Yu.
At that time, the Duke was recuperating from an arrow wound,
and remained stationed without moving his troops.
Reporting:
"Lu Meng, the general guarding Lukou in Jiangdong, is critically ill."
Sun Quan has recalled him for treatment.
Recently, Lu Xun has been appointed as general.
Substituted Lu Meng to guard Lukou. Now, Xun has sent a letter with proper etiquette,
Chapter Three, Aspect Three:
Clarify the external connections of the problem 75
I have come to pay my respects.
"Lord Guan was summoned,"
pointing to the envoy, he said:
"\"Zhongmou has short-sighted vision,"
and uses this child as a general!\" The envoy prostrated himself and said:
"General Lu presents this letter with gifts: "
Firstly, to congratulate you, Lord.
Secondly, to seek reconciliation between our two families.
I hope you will accept this with a smile.
"Gongchai took the letter and examined it."
The words in the letter were extremely humble and respectful.
Lord Guan finished reading it,
and looked up and laughed loudly.
He ordered his attendants to accept the gifts,
and send the messenger back.
The messenger returned to see Lu Xun and said:
'"Lord Guan is delighted,"'
There is no longer any intention to worry about Jiangdong.
”
Here, Lu Xun was not only able to perceive the cause of Lü Meng's illness,
but also actively offered suggestions and strategies for Lü Meng,
and shared the responsibility.
Under his careful planning and arrangement,
the "White Coats Crossing the River" plan was successfully implemented,
demonstrating Lu Xun's extraordinary wisdom in being responsible.
3. Take responsibility for yourself
Take responsibility for yourself,
is in any situation,
no matter what problem you are dealing with,
always be responsible for what you say
Take responsibility for your actions.
Always be true to your word,
and resolute in your actions.
In 350 BC,
Shang Yang prepared for the second reform.
After Shang Yang discussed the new laws he was preparing to implement with Duke Xiao of Qin,
he was not in a hurry to announce them.
He knew that,
If you cannot gain the trust of the people,
it will be difficult to implement the new laws.
In order to gain the people's trust,
Shang Yang adopted the following method.
On this day,
It was the day of the grand market in Xianyang City,
Inside and outside the city, the sound of people was noisy,
With heavy traffic.
As noon approached,
A team of guards and soldiers, guided by the sound of gongs clearing the way,
escorted a carriage towards the south of the city.
Besides a pole, the carriage contained

I have always been a responsible mother,
but I definitely don't want a third one.
Pokémon!
The soldiers carried the wooden poles under the cart,
and erected them.
An officer leading the team said loudly to the crowd:
"The Grand Commandant has ordered,"
Who can move this log to the North Gate will be rewarded with 10 taels of gold.
Reward 10 taels of gold.
"
The crowd was in an uproar.
A person from outside the city asked a person from inside the city,
Young people ask the elderly,
Children ask their parents...
…
No one can say for sure what's going on.
Because no one has ever heard of such a thing.
A young man rolled up his sleeves, wanting to give it a try,
But an elder beside him grabbed him,
and said:
"Don't go,
There's no such thing as something so cheap in the world.
To move a wooden pole and get 10 taels of gold,
We won't go and stick our necks out.
'"Someone followed up, saying:'
"Yeah,"
I don't think this will end well. Heads will roll.
”
People just watched and
talked about it.
No one was willing to step forward and try.
The officials read aloud Shang Yang's orders again,
Still, no one stood up.
On the city gate tower,
Shang Yang watched everything that was happening below without a word.
After a while,
He turned and gave a few instructions to the attendant beside him.
The attendant hurried downstairs,
Ran to the official standing guard by the wooden pole,
and conveyed Shang Yang's order.
After the official heard this,
he raised his voice and shouted to the crowd:
"The Grand Administrator has issued an order:"
Whoever can move this wood to the North Gate,
will be rewarded with 50 taels of gold!
The crowd was in an uproar.
Further believe that this cannot be true.
At this time,
A middle-aged man walked out
Chapter Three, Aspect Three:
Address external contacts to resolve the issue 17
The crowd cupped their hands to the officials,
text: text: saying:
"Since the Grand Master of the State has given the order,
I will come to move it,
I don't dare to expect 50 taels of gold,"
It's possible to give a small amount of money.
"
The middle-aged man shouldered the wooden pole and walked straight towards the north gate.
The onlookers followed him to the north gate again. After the middle-aged man put down the wooden pole, he was brought to Shang Yang by the official historian.
Shang Yang said to the middle-aged man with a smile:
"“You are a true hero I” Shang Yang took out 50 taels of gold,"
Weighed it in his hand,
text: text: saying:
"“Take it!”"
The news quickly spread from Xianyang in all directions,
The people of the country widely praised Shang Yang's reputation for keeping his word.
Shang Yang saw that the time was ripe,
and immediately introduced the new laws.
Thus, the second reform was a success.
During the Eastern Han Dynasty,
Zhang Shao from Runan Commandery and Fan Shi from Shanyang Commandery were studying in Luoyang, the capital city.
Their studies finished,
when they parted,
Zhang Shao stood at the crossroads,
looking at the wild geese in the sky and said:
"After today's farewell,
I don't know when we'll meet again..."
…
"As he spoke,"
tears streamed down his face.
Fan Shi held Zhang Shao's hand,
and advised him:
"Brother,"
Don't be sad.
In the autumn two years from now,
I will definitely visit your home to see the elders,
To have a gathering with you.
"
Falling leaves rustling,
Golden chrysanthemums blooming vibrantly,
This is exactly the autumn two years later.
Zhang Shao suddenly heard a wild goose cry in the long sky,
Fortunately, it stirred his emotions,
and he couldn't help but mutter to himself:
"He's coming soon."
"Having said that, he quickly returned to the house,"
and said to his mother:
"Mom,"
I just heard the wild geese calling in the sky,
Fan Shi is coming soon,
Let's get ready!" "Young child,
Shanyang E is more than a thousand miles away from here,
'"How could Fan Shi come?" His mother didn't believe it,'
Shaking his head and sighing:
"More than a thousand miles!" Zhang Shao said:
"Fan Shi is an upright and honest person,
sincere and fearful,"
Extremely trustworthy,
Won't fail to come.
"The old woman had to say:"
"Okay, okay,
He will come,
I'll go get some wine.
"Actually,
The old man didn't believe it.
Just afraid that my son would be sad,
Just comforting my son.
The agreed date arrived,
Fan Shi indeed arrived, travel-worn.
Old friend Chong Kui,
was exceptionally warm.
The old mother stood excitedly to the side, wiping away tears,
and said with emotion:
"Is there really such a trustworthy friend in the world!"
Fan Shi kept his word,
and his responsible behavior was passed down as a good story.
4. For others,
Group,
The country is responsible
Responsibility is a virtue of people.
When people analyze problems,
Not only should you be responsible for yourself,
but more so for others,
for a group, or for a country.
In the final years of Emperor Ling of Han,
Hua Xin and
Wang Lang escaped together in a boat.
A person wanted to board the boat,
Hua Xin was very embarrassed,
Wang Lang said:
"I hope you can be more generous,
What's wrong with giving someone a ride on a boat?" Later, the robbers chased after them,
Wang Lang wanted to throw the person who got a ride overboard,
Hua Xin said:
"The reason I hesitated just now
was precisely because of this.
Now that we have accepted him,
He has entrusted himself to us,
How can we abandon him because of danger?
From this incident,
Comparing Hua Xin with Wang Lang,
Hua Xin's spirit of taking responsibility for others
is even more commendable.
--One day,
a user in Phoenix urgently needed computer accessories to rebuild a multi-functional database.
After learning about this, IEM company
immediately sent a female employee to deliver it.
On the way, she encountered a heavy downpour,
and the river swelled rapidly.
Closed 14 bridges along the way,
Traffic is blocked,
Cars can no longer drive.
Normally, in this special situation,
The female employee had every reason to turn back,
but she was not deterred by the famine-stricken city and the dangers along the way,
and continued to forge ahead bravely,
cleverly utilizing the pair of ice skates that were originally stored in the car.
Gliding towards the destination,
The car journey, which usually takes only twenty-odd minutes,
has turned into a four-hour wade today.

After the failed operation to rescue the American embassy hostages in Iran,
At that time, U.S. President Jimmy Carter immediately solemnly declared on television:
"I am responsible for everything."
Just because of this sentence,
President Carter's approval rating suddenly rose by more than 10%.
Chapter 3, Aspect 3:
Clarify the External Connections of the Problem
What subordinates worry about most is making mistakes,
especially when they put in a lot of effort but still cause a major disaster.
Imagine you unfortunately get into big trouble one day,
unable to sleep at night,
and your boss says:
"\"All responsibility lies with me!\" What a state of mind that would be? President Carter's example illustrates,"
Subordinates' opinion of
a leader
often
depends on whether he has a sense of responsibility.
'Being willing to take responsibility not only makes subordinates feel safe,'
'but also makes subordinates reflect.'
'After reflection, they also discover their shortcomings.'
'Thus, they actively apologize in front of everyone.'
Take responsibility.
By doing this,
it seems like you are taking the responsibility on yourself,
making yourself the object of condemnation,
Essentially, it's just shifting the responsibility for the problem onto higher-level leaders.
This makes the problem easier to solve.
If in a group, superiors influence their subordinates,
and a culture of taking responsibility is formed,
This will prevent buck-passing,
and prevent disunity between superiors and subordinates,
giving the group greater cohesion,
and thus making it more competitive.
Zhao Pu of the Song Dynasty once served as the Prime Minister during the reigns of Emperor Taizu and
Emperor Taizong, two emperors who were highly respected.
His loyalty to the court and his political achievements were very evident.
He was a diligent senior administrative official.
He devoted his whole life to politics.
He took assisting the Song Dynasty in governing the country as his responsibility.
He was a rare and outstanding prime minister.
Once, Zhao Pu recommended an official to Emperor Taizu.
Emperor Taizu did not agree.
Zhao Pu was not discouraged.
The next day, at court, he again asked Emperor Taizu to approve the personnel appointment and requested Emperor Taizu to decide.
Emperor Taizu still did not agree.
Zhao Pu was still unwilling to give up,
and brought it up again on the third day.
He repeatedly brought it up three times in a row for three consecutive days,
and his colleagues were also surprised.
Why is Zhao Pu so shameless?
80 Analyze the nine aspects of dirty problem
So thick.
Emperor Taizu was angry this time.
He tore the memorial to shreds on the spot and threw it on the ground.
But Zhao Pu had his own way of doing things.
He silently took those torn pieces of paper—
—
picked them up,
Carefully glue it back together after getting home.
On the fourth day, he attended the court.
Without saying a word,
he held the glued-together memorial over his head and stood motionless before the Emperor Taizu.
Emperor Taizu was moved by his words,
and let out a long sigh,
and had no choice but to grant his request.
On another occasion,
An official was due for promotion based on his political achievements.
Zhao Pu, who was the Prime Minister, submitted a memorial proposing his promotion.
However, because Emperor Taizu usually disliked this person,
he ignored Zhao Pu's memorial.
But Zhao Pu acted out of public interest,
regardless of the emperor's likes or dislikes,
The previous display of resilience was even more astonishing.
Taizu asked:
"If I don't agree,"
What will you do this time?
Zhao Pu's expression didn't change:
"If there's a fault, it can be corrected,"
Merit must be rewarded.
This is an ancient precept,
an immutable principle.
The emperor should not disregard this principle based on his own preferences.” In other words,
Although you are responsible as the Emperor,
you cannot use personal feelings to handle matters of punishment and reward.
These words obviously offended Emperor Taizu of Song,
and in his anger, Emperor Taizu angrily flung his sleeves and left.
Zhao Pu followed closely behind, standing outside the gate of the imperial harem where the emperor was retiring.
He lowered his head,
remaining still for a long time,
resolving that he would not leave unless the emperor came out.
It is said that Emperor Taizu was very moved by this,
and agreed with his opinion.
The reason why Zhao Pu served as prime minister during two dynasties
was because of his outstanding achievements in government.
Being praised by the people
is inseparable from his sense of responsibility.
II.
Harmony is to be prized.
The problem is not the problem
《Mencius · Gongsun Chou》 has a blind person:
The favor of the heavens is not as important as the advantages of the earth,
The terrain is not as good as the people are united.
"The Art of War says:"
"Gaining the support of the many leads to victory:"
When those on the left and right are in harmony,
you win.
"As the saying goes:"
'"Harmony in the family brings success in everything," "Harmony brings wealth," "Harmony is to be valued,"'
'"Patience is paramount."'
The key to these sayings lies in the word 'harmony'.
When facing and analyzing problems, people should adhere to the principle of "harmony is the most valuable."
Analyze problems based on the principle of "harmony is the most valuable."
There are two specific approaches:
First, ask
Chapter Three, Aspect Three:
Clarify the External Connections of the Problem 81
Both parties work together on the issue,
To break down the problem from large to small,
Emanating from the small, tending towards the infinite
Finally resolved peacefully
Mutual concession and mutual benefit;
Secondly, within the group, starting from the overall situation,
Unite as one,
Cooperate tacitly,
Transform the problem in a direction that benefits the group's interests.
1. Complementary abilities,
Close cooperation
people,
Each has its strengths,
Each has its weaknesses.
People cooperate with each other,
And can unleash the greatest energy under coordination.
thereby producing a good organizational effect.
Because the group coordination is reasonable,
it can not only achieve the addition and concentration of abilities,
but more importantly, it can enable people to give full play to their strengths.
Complement each other's shortcomings.
In the 67th chapter of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms",
Cao Cao's three generals Zhang Liao,
Li Dian,
Le Jin and the other two worked together to defend Hefei,
Zhang Liao's prestige shook Xiaoyao Ford.
Cao Cao sent someone to deliver a wooden box to the front line in Hefei,
On the box was written:
"When the thief comes, then strike!"
"When Sun Quan leads an army of 100,000 to attack Hefei,"
Zhang Liao and others opened the box to look.
They saw that Cao Cao had written in the box:
"If Sun Quan arrives,"
Generals Zhang and
Li go out to battle,
General Yue defends the city.
"At that time, Cao Cao was far away in Hanzhong, thousands of miles away."
Why did he send this wooden box?
The subsequent developments are convincing.
convinced.
Cao Cao did this precisely because
it lies in
his understanding of the personalities of these three generals,
strengths,
Shortcomings,
The purpose is to facilitate Zhang,
Li,
Le's complementary personalities,
Complement each other's advantages,
To make them unite,
To jointly fight against the enemy,
And seek the best overall coordination.
Maximize their potential.
When the three saw Cao Cao's instructions,
Zhang Liao expressed his firm execution of Cao Cao's order to attack as a defense,
wanting to go out personally.
Demonstrates a fearless and broad mind in a 'do-or-die battle' with the enemy.
82 == Grasping nine aspects of problem analysis
Heroic spirit.
Li Dian 'was always on bad terms with Zhang Liao,' so regarding the suggestion made by Zhang Liao,
Initially, he was 'silent and unresponsive,' but later moved by Zhang Liao's actions.
He immediately expressed 'willingness to follow commands.' Yue Jin was an intermediate figure.
His attitude was ambiguous.
Towards Zhang,
Neither Li Dian nor Zhang Liao dared to offend him.
Because of Li Dian,
Zhang Liao both prioritized the overall situation,
With a formidable enemy before them,
The distance between the three people instantly melted away,
uniting in a moment of crisis,
and utterly defeating the once-invincible Wu army,
a single battle that made "everyone south of the Yangtze River afraid,"
Hearing the great name of Zhang Liao,
Even small children dare not cry at night.
The Chu-Han Contention is a well-known event.
The reason why Liu Bang was able to win the world
One of the important reasons is that he was able to unite Xiao He,
Zhang Liang,
and Han Xin around him,
allowing them to use their talents to build the Liu family's empire for him.
As Liu Bang himself said:
"Planning strategies in the tent,
Winning battles a thousand miles away,
I am not as good as Zhang Liang;
To govern the country,
To care for the people,
To provide salaries and provisions,
Without cutting off the supply lines,
I am not as good as Xiao He;
To command an army of a million,
To win every battle,
To conquer every siege,
I am not as good as Han Xin.
All three are outstanding talents.
I am able to employ them.
This is why I was able to conquer the empire.
"
2. Peace is the most precious thing,
Turn enemies into friends.
Harmony can lead to friendship,
War can create enemies.
If we can adhere to the principle of "harmony is the most valuable" when analyzing problems,
we can often turn danger into safety.
Feng Yuxiang was placed under house arrest by Yan Xishan under the pretext of discussing cooperation.
The Northwest Army generals held meetings every day to discuss countermeasures.

Although Feng Yuxiang repeatedly sent secret messengers,
urging the Northwest Army to persist in opposing Chiang Kai-shek,
Lu Zhonglin believed that opposing Chiang Kai-shek was just empty talk if the commander-in-chief was not rescued.
opposing Chiang Kai-shek was just empty talk.
"I can't wait any longer!" Lu Zhonglin said to the other generals with indignation.
"I will lead my men straight into Shanxi and not care about the consequences!"
I don't care what happens!
Under what pretext should we declare war on Yan Xishan?
Lu Zhonglin listed three major reasons:
First,
Years of civil war,
Yan Xishan is the culprit;
II.
The Northwest Army must have the Northwest as its base.
If Yan Xishan is not eliminated,
and Shanxi is not taken into our hands,
The Northwest Army would be forever threatened by it.
If the Northwest Army occupies Shanxi,
it can advance and attack,
and retreat and defend.
Third,
The Northwest Army must not stand idly by while its commander-in-chief is held under house arrest.
To save Feng Yuxiang,
We must confront Yan Xishan with military force.
Can the Northwest Army defeat the Jin Army? This is a crucial question.
"Damn it,"
I'm going to find Chiang Kai-shek.
""Lu Zhonglin shouted."
Representatives of the Northwest Army secretly entered Beijing,
Expressing to Chiang Kai-shek that,
The Northwest Army is willing to cooperate fully with the Central Government
to drive Yan Xishan out of Shanxi.
What a sinister and cunning man Chiang Kai-shek was! He—
Representatives of the Nanjing faction secretly negotiated with Yan Xishan,
urging Yan Xishan to kill Feng Yuxiang on the spot as soon as possible.
On the other hand, they told the representatives of the Northwest Army,
if the Northwest Army really has this determination,
The Central Government will definitely give its full support.
Shi Yousan's troops have begun to move from the Pinghan Railway towards Shijiazhuang.
Yan,
A fierce battle between Feng is about to break out.
But due to the leak of secrets,
Jian Xishan has already obtained the information.
He asked Feng Yuxiang:
"What kind of fake medicine are you selling? And you said you would cooperate with me."
If we continue talking,
the Northwest Army will occupy Taiyuan.
Feng Yuxiang was shocked,
and quickly defended himself:
"I had no idea about this at all."
"
Men Xishan said with a smile:
"Then it's probably your subordinates acting on their own initiative."
Are they always so fond of acting on their own initiative?
Feng Yuxiang's face flushed red instantly.
He couldn't say a word for a long time.
"In the past few days,"
"Chuang Xishan said slowly,"
"The representatives from Nanjing were in my office every day, refusing to leave."
They wanted me to take care of you right then and there.
I didn't agree to it.
Why? Isn't it because of our brotherly bond? Chiang Kai-shek might disregard friendship,
But we can't be unreasonable, can we?
You agree, right?
Feng Yuxiang stood up with a 'whoosh',
and said loudly, twisting his neck:
"Of course, I will cooperate with Mr. Yan to the end,"
And oppose Chiang to the end! The situation is urgent now,
Please trust me, Mr. Yan,
放
I'm going back,
I'll go and convince them.
If Mr. Yan doesn't believe me,
Then just consider it was me who told them to attack Shanxi.
But I, Ma Yuxiang, am definitely not the kind of person who goes back on their word and acts unjustly!
Yan Xishan was so moved that tears welled up in his eyes.
He grabbed Feng Yuxiang in a bear hug.
The two of them actually knelt on the ground and cried loudly.
"From now on," Yan Xishan said through gritted teeth,
"We share life and death,"
Share weal and woe,
Oppose Chiang and carry it through to the end.
"
Feng,
Yan and Feng swore an oath of brotherhood on the spot, sealed with blood.
And became brothers.
Yan Xishan gave Feng Yuxiang a batch of bullets and 200,000 in cash,
And sent a car overnight to take Feng Yuxiang to Fenglingdu.
III.
Leaving room for others is giving convenience to yourself.
Leave some leeway,
To put it bluntly,
It's about how to make yourself invincible when analyzing the aspirations.
That is, when attacking, one must consider retreating;
When surrounding the enemy, one must consider the enemy's counter-encirclement;
When taking advantage of the enemy's weakness, one must consider one's own vulnerabilities.
Being able to control others instead of being controlled by them,
That is a characteristic of a good strategist.
Once a plan is launched,
If successful, it will benefit oneself,
If it doesn't succeed, it won't harm me.
This is a win-win situation with a secure advance and retreat.
After Qin and Qi implemented the policy of Horizontal Alliance in 293 BC,
towards Han,
Yao and two other countries launched a large-scale offensive.
Han,
The states of Wei faced a common threat,
but they were ostensibly united but actually divided.
Passing the buck to each other,
No one wants to take the lead,
Everyone wants to stay behind and see which way the wind blows,
As a result, the alliance did not form an overall synergy
Suffered repeated defeats.
Therefore, both countries wholeheartedly sought help from Qi,
Preparing to rely on Qi's power,
To re-establish a coalition against Qin.
However, Qi's intention was not on Qin at this time.
Qi was single-mindedly focused on attacking and destroying the State of Song.
To expand its territory.
Han,
Shi had no choice but to become special horns to each other.
Struggling to resist Qin,
The two sides formed a stalemate.
But in 298 BC,
For its own benefit, the state of Wei
attempted to trap its old partner, the state of Han, and abandon it,
and instead made peace with Qin alone.
The situation became very unfavorable for Han.
At this time,
A strategist gave Han Xiang Gongzhong a thorough analysis of the current situation,
He said:
"Twins look very much alike in their childhood,"
Only their biological mother can tell them apart;
The advantages and disadvantages that exist in things,
They are also very similar on the surface.
Only those with profound wisdom can see through their essence.
The advantages and disadvantages that your country is currently facing,
就
Chapter 3, Aspect 3:
Clarify the external connections of the problem 85
They are as difficult to distinguish as twin sons.
If the correct approach is taken,
the monarch will not lose dignity.
The country will not be in danger;
If handled improperly,
disaster may befall us.
"
"Currently,
If Qin and Wei successfully negotiate peace,
and it's not you who seized the opportunity to facilitate it,
these two
countries will unite,
Plotting against South Korea.
In this situation,
If Han were to imitate Wei and negotiate peace with Qin,
Han's status would inevitably be lowered.
The monarch will also be looked down upon.
At that time,
King Qin will appoint someone he favors to control Han's
national affairs.
Make the Korean clothing follow the will of Qin.
Like this;
Your situation will be very dangerous.
Analyzing from the current situation,
Wei's plot, Gong Buru went to persuade Lord Chengan (a famous lobbyist of Han State) to actively bring Qin and
Wei sued for peace.
Whether the peace talks between the two countries are successful or not,
Very beneficial to Doohan.
If the peace talks succeed,
it will be thanks to your mediation and matchmaking,
Han will then become a meritorious official in the Qin-Wei alliance,
which will be beneficial to both the country and the ruler.
It can be favored by Wei,
and can also gain the friendship of Qin.
Besides,
Qin and Wei cannot trust each other forever,
Qin will be angry because it cannot get assistance from Wei.
It will definitely become close to Han and distance itself from Wei.
Wei will also not always submit
to Qin.
We must try to befriend Han and guard against Qin.
This way, you can be as easy as choosing cloth and cutting it at will.
"
"From this, it can be seen that"
If Qin and Wei unite,
They will all thank you;
If Qin and Wei split,
both countries will try to win you over.
By doing this,
Both advancing and retreating are very advantageous for Han.
I hope you will not hesitate in any way.
”
It can be seen from this that,
Strategists are aware of the changing circumstances in the competition.
Be able to discern acutely
You've done everything, leaving me no choice.
So, you have to bite the bullet.
◎
Sigh,
React flexibly,
Actively seek proactive countermeasures.
As Wei was about to abandon Han,
and negotiate peace with Qin alone,
if Han remained indifferent,
Ignoring it,
will inevitably place oneself in a very isolated position.
And what kind of countermeasures to take,
truly depends on the level of strategic thinking.
In the eyes of ordinary people,
Under this circumstance,
Han could only follow Wei,
and make peace with Qin together
In order to avoid isolation.
However, this kind of trailing strategy,
is ultimately passive,
inevitably decreasing
Han's low position between the states of Qin and Wei.
A brilliant strategist found a clever way to seize the initiative from a passive position—
—
Striving to be Qin,
a mediator for reconciliation between Wei.
Simultaneously gain the trust of both countries.
Thus,
transforming the entire "triangular" relationship in a direction favorable to South Korea.
1. Leave room for the other party
In an ancient battle,
when the victorious side forced the enemy to the last hillside,
the commander suddenly ordered
a full retreat.
His subordinates didn't understand his intention,
so they asked him:
Why give up the attack when victory is near?
The commander replied,
The enemy is already at their last stand.
Cornering the enemy leaves them no way out,
which is equivalent to strengthening the enemy's resolve to fight to the death,
and this will inevitably increase our casualties.
It's even possible that the enemy could turn defeat into victory.
What this commander said is indeed very wise.
A cornered beast will still fight.
How much more so a legion trapped in a dead end? This also gives us an insight.
That is, whether it's business negotiation or social
Chapter Three, Aspect Three:

Whether it's business negotiation or competition, don't push your opponent into a corner.
In mid-December 1948,
The first stage of the Pingjin Campaign concluded.
In this stage,
Mao Zedong skillfully besieged the Fu Zuoyi group in the North China region.
and to divide,
surround,
This pillow created conditions for each enemy annihilation in the next stage.
With our army confident of victory,
With the enemy forces facing a situation of overwhelming defeat,
Mao Zedong believed that there was a high possibility of winning over the enemy forces without a fight and getting them to surrender.
Moreover, the ancient capital of Beiping has a large number of cultural relics and historic sites,
and should be spared from destruction by artillery fire as much as possible.
Therefore,
He adopted a policy of combining military strikes with political efforts.
Fu Zuoyi attempted to follow a middle path of opposing Chiang Kai-shek without supporting the Communists.
This made Mao Zedong feel that,
"All reactionary things,"
If you don't hit them,
They won't fall.
"To force Fu Zuoyi to submit,"
Then color must be applied.
December 22nd and 24th,
The People's Liberation Army launched offensives against Xinbao'an and Zhangjiakou successively.
In one fell swoop, they wiped out more than 70,000 of Fu Zuoyi's core troops, on which he relied to build his career.
Immediately afterwards,
Mao Zedong instructed the CCP spokesperson to issue a statement,
Announcing a list of 43 war criminals,
Including Fu Zuoyi
This came after the military strike,
Giving him another political blow.
The war situation developed so quickly,
It was far beyond Fu Zuoyi's expectations.
Under military,
and political pressure,
he had to formally negotiate with the People's Liberation Army.
Mao Zedong instructed the People's Liberation Army on the Pingjin front,
The CCP's Peiping underground party organization,
"earnestly worked on Fu Zuoyi" through various channels, conveying the CCP's principled stance,
guidelines,
and policies towards Fu Zuoyi and his subordinates frankly to Fu Zuoyi himself
To facilitate its transformation.
During the negotiations,
In addition to adhering to the principles of "all troops should be converted into the People's Liberation Army" and "all areas should be transformed into liberated areas," the People's Liberation Army also
fully considered Fu Zuoyi's situation at the time.
Adopted the plan proposed by Fu Zuoyi,
that is, the Kuomintang army "transferred out of the cities of Peiping and Tianjin,
and went to the designated locations in accordance with the orders of the People's Liberation Army,
and reorganized into the People's Liberation Army according to the system of the People's Liberation Army." The representatives of both sides initialed the "Meeting Minutes."
On January 14, 1949,
Mao Zedong pointed out:
"The People's Liberation Army must resolutely deal with any reactionaries who dare to resist."
must be resolute,
Thoroughly,
Cleanly,
Annihilate them all.
On this very day,
The People's Liberation Army launched a fierce attack on Tianjin.
In just 29 hours of fierce fighting, they annihilated Chen Changjie's 130,000-strong army, which stubbornly resisted in Tianjin.
Tianjin was liberated.
The "Tianjin Approach" of resolving problems through combat was created.
The loss of Tianjin greatly shocked Fu Zuoyi.
This made him realize that his idea of taking a middle road
was simply not feasible.
So he reassigned Deng Baoshan, deputy commander of the North China "Suppression General Headquarters," as his plenipotentiary representative.
To hold higher-level negotiations with the People's Liberation Army.
January 19,
Both sides reached an agreement on the peaceful liberation of Beiping.
22nd,
Fu Zuoyi signed the "Beiping Peaceful Liberation Agreement."
He also took the initiative to propose that the army would not be disarmed, but instead, the troops would be moved out of the city in a phased manner.
To await the reorganization by the People's Liberation Army.
Zhang Dongsun called Fu Zuoyi's plan a "glorious handover."
Thus,
thus avoiding disarmament,
and saving face,
and distinguishing
At the uprising.
As for the People's Liberation Army,
as long as Fu Zuoyi could move his troops out of the city,
they could be disarmed or reorganized peacefully.
In order to avoid the destruction of Beiping,
Therefore, Fu Zuoyi's proposal was accepted.
On the 22nd,
The Kuomintang army in Beiping city marched out of the city,
Reorganization was implemented approximately one month after arriving at the designated garrison.
This led to the emergence of the Beiping model, which differed from the Tianjin model.
After the peaceful liberation of Beiping,
In Suiyuan, Fu Zuoyi's forces still included Dong Qiwu,
Sun Lanfeng,
and Liu Wanchun commanded an 80,000-strong army.
How to solve this army? Mao Zedong creatively proposed another unique solution—
—
Suiyuan Style.
Regarding the Suiyuan issue,
Mao Zedong said to Fu Zuoyi:
"With the peaceful uprising in Peiping,
the Suiyuan issue will be easily resolved,"
Can you put it down for a moment?
Waiting for their uprising.
'"Regarding the specific meaning of the Suiyuan method,"'
Mao Zedong said to Fu Zuoyi:
"The Suiyuan method is a way of fighting without using the army."
First draw a line of peace.
Let Dong Qiwu do the internal work first.
On the other hand, send a liaison office:
The railway was connected,
Facilitating people's postal communication,
and travel;
Trade has been boosted,
And gradually unify currencies;
Strengthen publicity and cultural exchange.
Then see when General Dong Qiwu feels it is appropriate to revolt,
and revolt whenever it is appropriate.
"
Chapter 3, Aspect 3:
Clarify the external connections of the problem h 89
Mao Zedong also said to Fu Zuoyi:
"\"You captured our cadres,"
You were released at the beginning of the liberation.
All the cadres who captured you,
Have now been released back to you.
"This refers to the Xinbao An,"
Zhangjiakou,
Sun Lanfeng, captured in the battles of Huailai and other places,
Guo Jingyun,
An Chunshan and others,
Fu Zuoyi was quite surprised by this:
"You released them all back,
what am I supposed to do?" Mao Zedong said:
"You can meet with them first,
Look at them,
and then send them all to Suiyuan...
…
When they arrive in Suiyuan, they can share their experiences,
and help the personnel in Suiyuan to learn
Raise awareness,
Help Dong Qiwu prepare for the uprising.
"Mao Zedong added:
"We will still need to use these people in the future! In the future, they will all be treated as uprising personnel."
"After listening to Mao Zedong's words,"
Fu Zuoyi was extremely grateful,
and deeply felt Mao Zedong's deep thoughts and long-term planning,
and his broad vision.
Thereafter,
The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, together with Fu Fang and Dong Qiwu from the Suiyuan side, after repeated consultations,
reached a draft of the "Suiyuan Peace Agreement" in May 1949.
According to the agreement,
the Liaison Office of the North China People's Government stationed in GuiSui entered GuiSui on July 16. However, due to the complex situation of the Kuomintang army in Suiyuan,
Kuomintang agents incited discord from within.
Dong Qiwu was unable to control the situation.
Comrade Wang Shixin of the Liaison Office was killed by agents.
The Liaison Office was forced to withdraw from Gui Sui.
The implementation of the agreement encountered setbacks,
Gui Sui
The city was in a state of panic,
Dong Qiwu was very anxious.
However, Mao Zedong's determination to solve the Suiyuan problem in the Suiyuan way was unwavering.
He said:
"Things are always tortuous,"
Revolution cannot be without sacrifice", "The liberation of Suiyuan,
"Using the 'Suiyuan Method' unchanged," and decided to entrust Fu Zuoyi to go to Suiyuan to promote the uprising,
And personally promised Fu:
After the Suiyuan Uprising,
there is no need for military control.
After the uprising, a military and political committee can be established,
with Mr. Yisheng (Fu Yu) as the chairman.
Unfortunately,
At this time, Chiang Kai-shek also sent Xu Yongchang, the veteran Minister of Military Affairs from the Jin-Sui clique, to Suiyuan to obstruct the uprising. However, Fu Zuoyi did not fail Mao Zedong's expectations.
90 Nine aspects of grasping and analyzing problems
entrusted,
After arduous and meticulous work,
finally, on September 19 of the same year, the Suiyuan Uprising was brought about.
In mid-October,
according to Mao Zedong's instructions,
Established the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee.
The Suiyuan Provincial Military Region and the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government,
chaired by Fu Zuoyi,
and Dong Qiwu respectively.
Thus far,
The Suiyuan model has been successfully implemented.
2. Leave room for yourself
In ancient Chinese society,
Few founding ministers were able to have a good beginning and a good ending.
In this regard,
Xiao He of the Han Dynasty did the best.
Xiao He and Liu Bang had known each other for a long time.
At that time,
Liu Bang was the chief of Sishui Pavilion,
Xiao He was the clerk in Pei County,
Both were from the same hometown,
Xiao He was knowledgeable,
And being very familiar with the law,
Liu Bang respected and trusted him especially,
Whenever Liu Bang handled things improperly,
Xiao He would always help point it out,
Offer suggestions and plans for him,
Therefore, the relationship between the two became closer and closer.
After Liu Bang raised an army in Pei County,
Xiao He followed him all the time.
Liu Bang almost always listened to him.
Chu,
The major policies of the Chu-Han contention and even the founding of the Han Dynasty
almost all came from Xiao He
Xiao He can be described as having made great contributions.
Xiao He indeed had a way of governing the country.
Soon, "Han Zhong was greatly stabilized," and the people were willing to work for Xiao He.
Xiao He's supply of provisions to Liu Bang was also sufficient and timely.
History records it this way:
"In the beginning of the Chu-Han Contention,"
at the start of the Chu-Han War,
King of Han, Liu Bang, ordered his chancellor Xiao He to stay and defend Guanzhong,
Assisting Crown Prince Liu Ying,
Governing commanderies and counties,
Raising provisions and supplies,
Personally leading a large army to the east to fight against Xiang Yu.
"Of course,"
Liu Bang wasn't completely without suspicion of Xiao He,
but Xiao He was able to leave himself some leeway.
In Chu,
During the difficult stage of the Han and Chu armies' stalemate,
the fighting was extremely fierce.
Liu Bang repeatedly sent envoys back to Guanzhong,
specifically to express his regards to Xiao He.
In this regard,
Xiao He didn't think much about it,
and the retainer Bao

appearing miracle.
As soon as Xiao He heard this,
he suddenly realized,
and quickly asked for advice on how to deal with it.
Bao Sheng continued, "To avoid future troubles,
My Lord, it would be better to select strong and promising young men from your relatives,
and have them escort provisions
to Xingyang to join the army.
In this way,
Then King Han would have no suspicion.
Xiao He acted according to the plan,
and sent many brothers, nephews, and sons,
escorting the grain and provisions.
Going to Xingyang.
Hua Bang heard what the Prime Minister said
He provided grain and materials and sent many relatives and offspring to join the army,
and was overjoyed.
Order to personally receive him:
When asked about the recent situation of Chancellor Xiao He.
The Xiao family children replied in unison:
"Thanks to the great fortune of the King of Han,
The Prime Minister is well.
But King Changyu braves the wind and bathes in the rain,
gallops on the battlefield,
and regrets not being able to personally accompany him.
Sharing the hardship. Now, we are specially dispatched to join the army,
willing to serve the Great King.
Liu Bang said very happily:
"The Prime Minister forgets his family for the sake of the country,
"Truly commendable loyalty!" Immediately,
summoned Bu Guang,
ordering them to recruit the Xiao family's descendants:
with talent
Xiao He's doubts,
were thus resolved.
Later, when Liu Bang returned to the state, he repeatedly had doubts about Xiao He,
but Xiao He carefully and skillfully resolved them.
But there was also a dangerous time,
and he was only able to turn danger into safety with the help of his retainer Zhao Ping.
Zhao Ping was a very insightful person,
During the Qin Dynasty, he was the Marquis of Leling.
After the Qin Dynasty was destroyed, he became a commoner.
He lived a poor life.
He made a living by growing melons east of Chang'an.
Because the melons he grew were sweet,
People at the time called it the Leling melon.
After Xiao He entered the Pass,
he heard of Zhao Ping's virtuous reputation,
and only then did he recruit him to his staff.
In the ninth month of the tenth year of the Han Dynasty (197 BC),
Chen Xi rebelled,
and Liu Bang led troops to suppress the rebellion.
Han Xin also seized the opportunity to plot a rebellion.
With Xiao He's help, Empress Lü
·
plotted and killed Han Xin.
Liu Bang learned of this,
He then sent someone back to Chang'an.
He appointed Xiao He as Chancellor.
He increased Duì's estate to five thousand households.
And he granted him a bodyguard of five hundred men.
The ministers heard the news.
They came in droves
Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
to congratulate him,
but Zhao Ping came to offer his condolences.
Zhao Ping said to Xiao He:
"You, sir, are about to face a great disaster!" Xiao He was shocked,
and hurriedly asked:
"Why do you say that?" Zhao Ping said:
"His Majesty has been fighting wars for years,"
Only you stay safe in the capital,
Without taking risks.
When Han Xin was about to rebel against Chang'an,
The Emperor is already suspicious.
Now that Han Xin has just died, you are being granted additional honors.
Sending the guard to protect you,
supposedly to show you favor,
In reality, he suspects you.
"Isn't this a great disaster about to happen?" After hearing this, Xiao He
suddenly understood,
and urgently asked:
"What you say is very true,"
"I don't know what to do?" Zhao Ping said:
"You can refuse the title and not accept it,"
And take out your private wealth,
Divert it for military supplies to
You can avoid disaster.
'"Xiao He nodded in agreement,'
Thereupon,
He only accepted the title of Chancellor,
and offered to return his fief,
and use his family wealth to reward the army.
After Liu Bang heard this,
All doubts were dispelled.
The King of Huainan, Ying Bu, rebelled,
Liu Bang led his troops on a southern expedition against Ying Bu.
During the campaign,
Liu Bang sent envoys back to Chang'an many times,
asking the Prime Minister what he had been doing lately.
The envoy reported:
"Because Your Majesty is busy with military affairs,
The Prime Minister comforted the people in the capital city and
prepared military provisions, etc.
A retainer heard about this and,
found Xiao He and said:
"You are not far from extermination."
"Xiao He was immediately shocked and dismayed,"
not knowing why.
The retainer then continued:
"Your rank is now at the level of Prime Minister,"
Your achievements are the greatest,
There's no further title to bestow.
The sovereign has repeatedly asked about you,
Actions taken,
I fear that you have been living in Guanzhong for a long time,
and are deeply popular with the people.
If they take advantage of our weakness to act,
Wouldn't that mean the Emperor would be unable to return from his journey? Now, if you don't understand the Emperor's intentions,
and still diligently serve the people,
it will only deepen the sovereign's suspicions.
May I ask what will happen if things continue like this?
Isn't a great disaster about to befall you? Thinking of you now,
you might as well buy more private houses,
forcibly buy and sell at low prices,
and ruin your good reputation
Make the people speak ill of you.
In this way,
after the ruler hears of it,
you can protect yourself.
The family can also be safe and sound.
"Xiao He accepted the plan and implemented it.
After Liu Bang learned of this,
he finally felt relieved.
After Liu Bang pacified Ying Bu, he returned to Chang'an.
On the way, many people stopped him to submit petitions,
accusing Xiao He of forcibly buying farmland from the people.
Xiao He entered the palace to see the emperor.

Liu Bang asked, with a mixture of belief and doubt:

Zhang Liang replied:

Liu Bang asked anxiously:
"What should we do then?"
Zhang Liang asked in return:
"Who was the person the Emperor hated the most in the past?"
Liu Bang said:
"It was Yong Chi,
I wanted to get rid of him as soon as I had peace."
”
Zhang Liang said:
"Now,
You must immediately reward him in front of all the officials,
and those who are anxious will calm down."
"
Liu Bang did as Zhang Liang told him.
Sure enough,
a potential crisis was averted.
This matter,
This not only reflects Zhang Liang's sharpness and depth in thinking about problems,
but also demonstrates Liu Bang's ability to think dialectically.
In terms of personal grievances and the overall national situation,
he was able to prioritize the overall situation
Readily accepting good advice,
Demonstrating the demeanor of a wise ruler analyzing issues with great insight.
The ability to think dialectically,
is not only reflected in handling major national affairs,
It is also reflected in the handling of occasional problems in daily life.
Once,
The famous writer Liu Shaotang, when lecturing to students at a certain university about adhering to Party principles in literary creation,
a female college student raised a question:
"You say that writers should do some things and not do others,"
98 Interesting analysis of the nine aspects of the problem
I don't think it should be this way.
Since it's real,
It just exists;
What exists should be expressed,
Then you can write.
”
After Liu Shaotang heard this,
He didn't directly defend himself,
but instead asked the female college student to show him her student ID.
Then he asked:
"Why didn't you take a picture when you had sores on your face?
Then stick it on top?
The female college student asked, puzzled,
asking:
"Why would I take a film of my boil and stick it on my student ID when I have a boil? That's really strange."
”
Liu Shaotang continued:
"You wouldn't take a picture of yourself when you have sores,"
Nor would you paste a photo taken when you had sores onto your student ID card,
This shows that you think you are pretty.
Not being beautiful is temporary,
It's not your most authentic self,
So you don't want to take photos to commemorate it,
And you especially don't want to paste such a photo on your student ID.
Certain shortcomings of the Communist Party should be criticized,
but some
things have their special reasons,
and involve many aspects of the problem,
Measures should be taken within the Party to correct it.
But you insist on exposing it,
Wouldn't that be like the Communist Party posting X-rays of its sores on its work permits? Why are you so fair to yourself,
对
but the Communist Party is so unfair?"
A few words,
convinced this female student completely.
In dealing with this type of problem,
Liu Shaotang was not only able to think dialectically about problems himself,
Moreover, it uses clever rhetorical questions.
Inspiring female college students to think dialectically as well.
Thus, achieving a win-win result.

II.
What will be the result of the problem?
When a problem arises,
What will be the result? Will this result be beneficial or harmful to oneself? Smart people can always "see the end from the beginning" when it comes to the consequences of problems.
Otherwise,
Once you are negligent and careless,
You may fall into someone else's trap.
After an American guest visited Mao Zedong's former residence in Shaoshan,
he ate at a privately owned restaurant nearby.
The proprietress was a master of authentic Hunan cuisine,
which greatly satisfied the American guest.
After the payment,
the customer suddenly asked:
"If Chairman Mao Zedong were still alive,
would he allow you to open a store?" This question is difficult to answer:
To say allow it,
is clearly unrealistic,
To say disallow it,
carries a sense of belittling and negation
Simply not answering,
will also affect the atmosphere of the conversation.
But seeing the proprietress pondering slightly,
she replied with a smile:
"If it weren't for Chairman Mao,"
I would have starved to death long ago,
How could I possibly have opened a shop?
This is after a careful analysis of the results of the problem,
Cleverly answering a question irrelevantly.
The American asked a "strange" question, and the proprietress answered "skillfully."
When the proprietress dealt with this problem,
The good thing is that she avoided the essence of the question.
Responding with a "song,"
even if the other party cannot achieve the purpose of the questioning,
it also avoids embarrassment in the social situation,
and also safeguards the country
Nation,
Personal dignity,
Can be described as smooth,
Straightforward,
Impeccable.
1960s,
During an interview with Premier Zhou, a Western journalist
asked the following question regarding the financial situation:
"How much RMB does the People's Bank of China actually have?" This question involved state secrets.
Premier Zhou did not answer immediately.
After a little thought, he smiled and said:
"18 yuan, 8 jiao, 8 fen.
The People's Bank of China has reliable credit,
The currency value is stable.
"The other party couldn't help but be stunned for a moment when they heard this."
Before he could come back to his senses,
Premier Zhou continued to explain:
"The denominations of the currency issued by the People's Bank of China are 10 yuan,"
, 5 yuan,
2 yuan,
1 yuan;
5 jiao,
2 jiao,
1 jiao;
5 fen,
2 minutes.
1 minute.
These 10 RMB add up to exactly 18 yuan, 8 jiao, and 8 fen.
"The reporter was greatly impressed after hearing this."
Premier Zhou's answer was actually irrelevant.
He transformed the question of the amount of funds in the People's Bank of China into a question of the face value of Chinese Renminbi.
He skillfully dodged the other party's embarrassment.
He avoided a confidential issue.
Answered a well-known question.
The concept conversion is clever,
The answer is reasoned and well-founded,
It's understandable.

Learn to See the Essence Through Problems
Problems in life come in various forms.
Different problems have different characteristics and different contradictions.
Different problems,
imply different relationships and different balance points of interests.
Therefore,
When encountering problems,
it is important to clearly identify the essence.
Take different approaches to problems with different intentions.
Adopt different processing methods.
Chapter Four, Aspect Four:
Clarify the origin of the problem 101
During the Korean War,
an American reporter interviewed Premier Zhou Enlai.
Premier Zhou had just finished reading the documents,
and casually put the pen on the table.
The reporter, upon seeing that it was an American-made "Parker" pen,
asked with ill-concealed intent:
"Excuse me, Premier,
you dignified Chinese people,
Why do we still need to use American-made pens?
Premier Zhou replied with a hearty laugh:
"Speaking of this pen,
"That's a long story.
This is no ordinary pen;
It is a trophy from the Korean War,
Given to me as a gift by a Korean friend.
I think it's very meaningful,
Then I'll accept it.
"
After the reporter heard this,
he couldn't say a word.
The reporter's question was intended to satirize China's backwardness.
Faced with such hostile attacks in diplomatic settings,
A sharp and stern rebuttal is certainly one way to respond,
But it wouldn't reflect the grace and magnanimity of a great nation.
Premier Zhou's extraordinary quality lay in this:
A clever counterattack was launched amidst laughter.
It expresses the confidence and pride of the Chinese people with loud and cheerful laughter,
and also uses "war
trophies",
"Words like 'meaning' hint at China's victory and the failure of the American imperialist invaders."
Thus, ill-intentioned journalists felt a heavy sense of loss in the polite and gentle atmosphere created by the Premier.
This is a kind of defeat that the opponent cannot resist and cannot express.
The problems in life are also like this.
A patient entered the hospital and
said to the nurse:
"Please arrange for me to be in a third-class ward,
because I am very poor."
”
Nurse asked:
"Is there no one who can help you?"
102 Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
Patient replied:
"No,"
I only have one older sister,
She is a nun,
And very poor.
"The nurse teased:"
"The nun is very rich,"
Because she is married to God.
"The patient heard this,"
Extremely angry,
he retorted:
"Okay,"
then put me in a first-class ward,
From now on, just send the bills to my brother-in-law.
”
The nurse is a snob,
mocks patients,
and the service attitude is very bad.
The patient did not directly refute the nurse's sarcasm,
Instead, they followed her line of thought and continued.
"Since my sister married God,"
then God is my brother-in-law,
Then you can arrange for me to be in the first-class ward.
"However,"
Suddenly, a "reversal" occurred: "Just send the bill to my brother-in-law."
This ingenious answer,
'Leave the unethical nurse speechless and dumbfounded.'
Stunned.
'IV.'
Put all the problems on the table
Analyzing problems is a science.
When we consider how to deal with the problems we face,
we should try as much as possible to understand the
occurrence of the problem,
Comprehensively analyze the development and outcome.
Envision various possibilities for the development of the problem.
Then select the best solution.
Strive to handle the problem perfectly.
While Kongming and Yunchang were sitting,
a man reported that Guan Ping had arrived,
All the officials were shocked.
Guan Ping entered,
Presenting Xuande's letter.
Kongming examined it,
Inside it said:
"This year, on the seventh day of the seventh month,
Military Advisor Pang was shot and killed by Zhang Ren with an arrow at Luofeng Slope.
"Kongming cried bitterly,"
all the officials shed tears.
Kongming said:
"When the lord was in a dilemma at Fu Pass, "
Liang had no choice but to

Go.
"Yun Chang said:
"If the strategist leaves,
who will defend Jingzhou? Jingzhou is an important place.
The matter is of great importance.
Kongming said:
"Although the lord did not explicitly name the person in the letter,
I already understand his meaning.
"Then, he showed XuanDe's letter to all the officials, saying:"
"In the lord's letter,"
He entrusts Jingzhou to me,
Instructing me to assess my abilities and use them accordingly.
Nevertheless,
I am now sending Guan Ping with a letter,
The intention is for Lord Yun Chang to take on this important task.
Yun Chang is thinking of the bond of brotherhood in the Peach Garden,
You must do your utmost to guard this place.
Your responsibility is not light,
You should strive to fulfill it.
"Yun Chang did not decline further,
Agreed readily.
Kongming prepared a banquet,
and handed over the seal of authority.
Yun Chang received it with both hands.
Kongming held up the seal and said,
"This matter entirely depends on you, General."
Yun Chang said,
"A great man who has accepted an important task,"
Only death will stop me.
"When Kongming saw Yun Chang say the word 'death',"
he was displeased;
He wanted to refuse him,
His words have been spoken.
Kongming said:
"\"If Cao Cao leads his troops here,"
what should we do?\" Yunchang said:
"Resist him with force."
"Kongming then said:"
"If Cao Cao and"
Sun Quan,
If Qi rises in arms, what should we do?
Yun Chang said, "Divide the troops to resist them."
"Kongming said, "If we do that,"
"If that's the case,"
Jingzhou is in danger.
I have eight words,
General, keep them in mind,
and you can hold Jingzhou.
Yun Chang asked:
"What eight characters?" Kong Ming said:
"In the north, resist Cao Cao,
Ally with Sun Quan in the east."
"Yun Chang said:"
"The strategist's words"
Should be engraved in my heart.
”
The result of the matter
As everyone knows.
Yun Chang forgot Kong Ming's "eight words," leading to the loss of Jingzhou.
He was defeated and fled to Maicheng.
On the issue of how to defend Jingzhou,
Kongming seriously considered all the possibilities of the problem - what if we can hold it? What if we can't hold it? How can we hold it? Kongming first rejected Yun Chang's wrong idea of ​​only knowing how to fight to the death,
Then he put forward the correct proposition—
—
"Resist Cao Cao in the north,
and ally with Sun Quan in the east."
It can be described as meticulous in thinking,
and thoughtful in consideration.
After World War II,
Mr. Takeji Yamamoto, who was called the most outstanding strategist of the Japanese conservatives,
Helped Ichiro Hatoyama become Prime Minister.
The height of his talent,
The depth of his wit,
Everyone admired him for it.
However, he has always been plagued by scandals.
In his later years,
a representative of a women's group visited him,
and very impolitely asked him:
"Mr. Miki,"
Your every move,
can affect national affairs,
but you are very close to two women,
What exactly is going on here?
The question is very direct,
and very sharp.
How to answer it,
Analyzing Saburo Miki's problem-solving skills is also a test.
Saburo Miki thought:
If I answer according to the other party's questions,
it would be tantamount to admitting my own 'scandal', which would not only damage my reputation
104 Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
pattern,
and may also affect the national image;
If you deny the other party's question,
It also means being led by the nose by the other party,
and you also appear to be very passive,
Moreover, this kind of answer is too vulgar,
which is also inconsistent with one's own identity.
Moreover,
After this kind of negative response,
the other party may have a second,
or even a third question to follow up with.
So how did Takeji Miki answer this question?
After Miki Takeji heard this,
he appeared indifferent,
and casually replied to her:
"Not just two women! Now I have relationships with five women."
have a relationship with,
have dealings with!
The representative was stunned.
Then he continued,
"These five ladies,
took care of me when they were young,
now they are all old and frail,
Of course, I have to take care of them financially.
And spiritually.
”
From then on,
this representative not only stopped blaming him,
On the contrary, they admired his personality very much,
and testified for him everywhere.
The reason why Takeji Miki was able to, under the opponent's questioning,
effectively block the opponent's offensive,
Because he considered all the possibilities of the problem,
when answering, he first followed the other party's question and answered accordingly,
the answer was beyond the other party's expectation,
leaving the other party stunned on the spot,
Then add color to it,
"These five ladies,
took care of me when they were young,
now they are all old and frail,
Of course, I have to take care of them financially.
And spiritually.

The home of Japanese female writer Ayako Sono was burglarized.
A group of criminals broke into the bedroom.
Ayako Sono told them:

"Let's go quickly!" The gangsters were shocked to hear this,

The reason for this result is that

Ability Training
Training 1:
Thank You Note
Practice Time:
5 minutes
Required resources:
Laptop,
Email or word processor
In real life, most of us are not in the habit of writing thank-you notes,
perhaps because we are too busy.
Actually,
Although this measure seems trivial,
But sometimes it is very necessary,
because the information it conveys is of great importance.
When someone does a good job for you,
write them a "thank you" letter.
For example,
someone went to great lengths to install your air conditioner,
Or,
a supplier did his best to get you the goods you needed ahead of schedule,
It's necessary to write a letter of thanks for this,
Wouldn't doing so be too much trouble (especially if there's an email address, it's even simpler)?

Occasionally
If you're feeling dejected by bureaucracy,
you might feel that a formal evaluation system is completely unnecessary.
You may be right,
but if you don't regularly evaluate your progress towards your goals,
Without estimating the size of successes,
and without noting room for improvement,
then your feeling has no real basis,
and it is easy to judge that nothing important has been done.
Ideally,
The evaluation should be informal,
in order to check progress

situation,
Accurately identify the key points of the inspection,
Continuously pay attention to the effectiveness of the work,
Continuously and promptly improve working methods.
Unfortunately,
even people with good intentions cannot do it according to this requirement,
we can only reluctantly resort to formal evaluation systems.
But it should be applied correctly.
Because people are sometimes too busy,
evaluations are often delayed,
therefore,
Formal evaluation systems should be given the highest priority.
Before the formal evaluation,
Achievements and opportunities for improvement should be brought together.
If a form is used for evaluation,
Be careful not to have too much content in the indicators in the table.
Just make sure you can explain the correct result.
Set appropriate content for each checked column and define it.
So that you can score according to the work situation
And it must also be ensured that these results remain valid in the subsequent period.

Members of the group or subgroup do not get along well,
then this technique is very applicable.
If this situation has affected the work of the group members,
Then you need to discuss solutions with other people.
Consider the following three situations:
Take two minutes to write down,
What would you do in each situation?
Paul always annoyed Sue.
Sue liked to bury herself in her work quietly.
But Paul always chatted with her,
And asked her questions.
●Bill and Jim are both experts in the IT industry:
Bill is an expert in computer programming languages,
He recommends that the entire company adopt a new computer language:
Gumm is a commercial computer expert,
He disagreed with doing so,
believing that Bill's recommendation was not based on practical application,
but was too theoretical.
●Mandy is Simon's team leader,
Although Mandy is married,
she has grown to like Simon more and more,
and has begun to have sexual transgressions,
while Simon doesn't like Mandy.
For the first case,

A few,
talk to them individually,
and then let them get along together.
For the third case,
which is even more difficult.
The best approach is usually to transfer one or both of them to different work groups.
In these cases,
fundamental measures need to be taken to solve the problem.
If not,
the entire working group may lose motivation.
You never dare to get to the bottom of things about yourself,
because you didn't expect yourself to be the root of the problem.

Between the summer and autumn of 1805,
The Third Coalition against France in Europe is formed.
Napoleon realized that war was inevitable,
and took corresponding measures against various countries.
When Austrian troops began moving towards Tyrol, which bordered northern Italy,
Napoleon immediately seized the opportunity,
to fuel this action of the Austrian army,
in order to disperse the Allied forces.
He decided to use reverse psychology,
Instruct Foreign Minister Talleyrand to issue a warning to the Austrian ambassador,
text: text: saying:
"Tell the Austrian ambassador,"
I await his reply.
If I don't get a reply,
then I will go to Switzerland,
and end my coastal camp;
I will not allow any troops in Tyrol,
The Austrian army must return to its original garrison.
Otherwise,
"I will declare war." To issue such a note,
is tantamount to clearly implying to the Austrians that
France, as in the past,
intends to launch an attack from the direction of Italy.
As a result,
Austria was indeed fooled,
Act swiftly towards Italy.
Place the main force, led by Duke Charles, in Italy.
This provided favorable conditions for the next operation of the French army.
After the war started,
France, however, attacked Austria from the Danube Valley,
Easily captured the Austrian capital, Vienna,
And forced Austria to surrender.
Napoleon dictated terms to Austria,
Austria intentionally opposed him,
right into
Napoleon's diversion tactic,
thus the defeat was already determined.
Napoleon realized that war was inevitable when the Third Coalition against France was formed in Europe.
He realized that war was inevitable.
This ability to see the significant in the trivial,
enabled Napoleon to take appropriate measures against various countries in a timely manner.
Thus, victory is assured.

War is inevitable.
At that time,
Japan was a rising imperialist country,
while Tsarist Russia was an old-fashioned imperialist power,
and Japan's naval strength was no match for Russia's.
Therefore, many Japanese naval officers and soldiers were also somewhat fearful of Russia.
They believed that defeating the Qing Dynasty was not difficult,
but going to war with Russia
was simply betting the fate of the nation.
Once we fail,
It will lead to national subjugation and extermination of our race.
However, Navy Commander Heihachiro Togo did not blindly believe in numerical comparisons or superficial phenomena.

At that time, someone asked him:
'"What do you think of the Russian fleet?" Togo said:'
'"Not as terrible as people imagine."'
'"What do you mean?" The questioner and many officers present pricked up their ears,'
'wanting to hear his opinion.'
He said:
"I looked out at the Russian fleet,
and it's hard to say that their military discipline is strict,
or that they are well-trained."
They used warships to transport infantry and military supplies,
which is even more unforgivable.
This proves that they despise the original function of warships.
Using warships instead of transport ships,
Inevitably consume their combat power,
Cause their training to be neglected,
In this way,
Once a naval battle occurs,
Ships cannot fully exert their combat effectiveness,
That's one aspect.
On the other hand, it also exposes the inadequacy of their maritime transportation capabilities.
If a naval battle occurs between Japan and Russia,
The war will definitely take place in the sea cities around Japan,
which is even more disadvantageous for them.
From this it can be seen that,
Russia's preparation for sending troops was insufficient,
We don't need to be afraid of Russia.
"Everyone present nodded in agreement with Togo's analysis.
The subsequent Russo-Japanese War,
Although the tonnage of the Russian Pacific Fleet and Baltic Fleet was about twice that of the Japanese fleet,
However, these last two fleets were almost completely annihilated by the Japanese army.

Seeing Trends Through Initial Signs
Chapter 84 of *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*:
Lu Xun burned seven hundred miles of camps,
Kongming skillfully arranged the Eight Trigrams Formation.
In this episode,
Regarding Liu Bei's method of setting up camp along streams and valleys,
It describes the views of three people,
and they are consistent.
All three have strong insights,
which can be seen from Liu Bei's method of setting up camp
The trend of Liu Bei's inevitable defeat.
You have a tendency to be devious and unpredictable.
First,
Ma Liang arrives in Sichuan,
He entered to see Kongming,
and presented the map and said,
"Now we are moving camp to Yangjiang,"
occupying seven hundred li horizontally,
Conquered over forty villages,
All nestled along streams and brooks,
In places where forests and trees flourished.
The Emperor ordered the able general Tu Benlai to show it to the Prime Minister for his perusal. Kongming finished reading it,
He slapped the table and cried out in agony, saying:
"Who is the leader who ordered such a poor strategy for the lower camps? This person should be executed!" Ma Liang said:
"It was all the lord's own doing,
not someone else's plan." Kong Ming sighed and said:
"The fate of the Han Dynasty is exhausted!"
Liang asked him why.
Kongming said:
"Bao Yuan separated obstacles and formed a camp,"
This is a major taboo in military strategy.
If they use fire attack.
How can we remedy that? Moreover, how can a continuous encampment of seven hundred miles resist the enemy? Disaster is not far off! Lu Xun's holding back and refusing to engage,
is precisely for this reason.
You should go to see the Emperor quickly,
Change the garrisons in all the camps,
It cannot be like this.
"Liang said:"
"Now that the Wu soldiers have already won, what should we do?"
Confucius said:
"Lu Xun dare not come after us,
Chengdu can be preserved without worry."
"Liang said:"
"\"Why didn't Xun pursue?\" Kongming said:"
"\"I fear Wei soldiers would attack from the rear."
If the sovereign is lost,
He will flee to Baidi City to avoid me.
When I entered Sichuan,
I had already ambushed 100,000 soldiers at Yufupu.
'"Liang was greatly surprised and said:"'
"I have traveled back and forth to Yufu Ford several times,"
and have never seen a single soldier.
"Why does the Prime Minister make such deceitful statements?" Kong Ming said:
"You will see them later,"
Don't bother asking.
"Ma Liang requested a memorial,
and rushed to the imperial camp.
Kongming returned to Chengdu himself,
Dispatch military forces for rescue.
Secondly,
Han Dang and
Zhou Tai learned that the First Lord had moved his camp to Liang.
Urgent reports were sent to Lu Xun.
Lu Xun was overjoyed.
He then led his troops to observe the situation in person.
He saw a camp set up on flat ground.
Fewer than ten thousand people,
Most of them are old and weak
rabble,
A large flag reading "Vanguard Wu Ban"
Zhou Tai said,
"I regard these kinds of soldiers as child's play."
I am willing to divide our forces with General Han into two groups to attack them.
If we don't win,
Willingly accept military orders.
"Lu Xun looked at it for a long time,
and pointed with his whip, saying:
"In the valley ahead,
A faint sense of murderous intent arises;
There must be an ambush beneath.
Therefore, they set up this weak force on flat ground,
To lure us in.
"Gentlemen, you must not go out." All the generals listened,
and all thought it was cowardly.
The next day,
Wu Ban led troops to the pass.
Preliminary challenges,
Displaying military might,
Incessant insults and abuse;
Many were disrobing and removing their armor,
Stark naked,
Some sleeping, some sitting.
Xu Sheng,
Ding Feng entered the tent and reported to Lu Xun:
The Shu soldiers are deceiving me
Too much? We are willing to attack!" Xun smiled and said:
You only rely on your brute courage
Unknown Sun,
Wu Miaofa.
This is a ploy to lure the enemy;
We will know the truth in three days.
"Xu Sheng said:
"Three days later,"
"They will have already settled their camp after moving.
"How can we attack them?" Xun said:
"It is precisely because I want them to move their camp.
"The generals laughed and retreated."
After three days,
He gathered the generals to observe from the gate,
and saw that Wu Ban's troops had retreated.
Xun pointed and said:
"The killing intent is rising.
Liu Bei will definitely emerge from the mountain valleys."
Before he finished speaking,
I saw the Shu soldiers were all fully armed,
escorting the late emperor.
When the Wu soldiers saw them,
they were all terrified.
Xun said:
"The reason I didn't listen to you all to beat the gong
is precisely because of this.
Now the ambushes have been sprung,
Within ten days,
We will surely defeat Shu.
" All the generals said:
"The best time to defeat Shu was at the beginning;
Now the camps are linked for five or six hundred miles,
Defending each other for seven or eight months,
And all the important strategic points,
Are already strongly defended.
How can we defeat them?” Xun said:
"You gentlemen do not understand military tactics."

A hero,
More wisdom and strategy,
When his troops first gathered,
Laws and regulations were precise and specialized;
Now, we have been defending for a long time,
But it's not advantageous for us.
Our soldiers are exhausted, and their will is hindered.
"Taking it is precisely today." Only then were the generals convinced.
Third,
The late lord at Xiaoting
completely mobilized the navy,
going downstream,
garrisoned water camps along the river
Deep into Wu
Realm.
Huang Quan advised:
"Naval forces"
Going down the river,
It's easy to advance,

But difficult to retreat.
Your subject is willing to lead the vanguard.

Your Majesty should remain in the rear guard,
So that there is absolutely no

"The late Emperor said:"
"The Wu bandits are胆 (dǎn - gall/courage)

"What's the harm?" The officials earnestly remonstrated,
先
The lord did not listen.
So he divided the troops into two groups:
Ordered Huang Quan to oversee the troops north of the Yangtze River,
以
to defend against Wei invaders;
The Former Lord personally oversaw the various armies south of the Yangtze River,
and established separate camps along the Yangtze River
Aiming to make progress through planning and strategy.
A spy discovered,
And reported it to the Wei ruler overnight,
Saying, "The Shu army is attacking Wu,"
A palisade connected the camps,
stretching over 700 li,
divided into more than 40 settlements,
all built near the mountains and forests;
Currently, Huang Quan is commanding troops on the north bank of the river.
They send out patrols over a hundred li every day.
不
I wonder what his intentions are.
”
When the Wei ruler heard of this,
Looking up and laughing, he said:
"Liu Bei is about to be defeated!" The ministers asked him the reason.
The Lord of Wei said:
"Liu Xuande does not understand military strategy:
How could there be a continuous camp stretching for 700 li?
And can resist the enemy? Those who rely on natural barriers and strategic locations to garrison troops,
This is a major taboo in military strategy.
Xuande will be defeated by Lu Xun of Eastern Wu.
Within ten days,
news will definitely arrive.

"Small" matters must not be "underestimated"
A case like this once happened in the United States.
A female university president suddenly withdrew all her savings from a certain bank where she had deposited money for many years.

Many people wonder why she has such amazing foresight.
Later, this lady told people that,
Once, she was playing cards with some people,
and the general manager of this bank was also present.
She noticed that this manager was quite particular about his attire,
even his fingernails were meticulously manicured at a high-end salon.
She immediately felt that
her savings were in danger of disappearing,
because a
man with a strong sense of career would not spend so much energy and money to embellish himself.
From this, it can be seen that
"Small" matters should not be "small"ly regarded.
This kind of insight that sees the big picture in small things
is not only beneficial to our daily life,
Moreover, it is also beneficial for law enforcement officers in handling cases.
In previous years,
After the American spy Thomson was arrested by our public security organs,
he insisted that he was a scholar.
Refused to admit his identity as a spy.

Thomson claimed that he was studying Guanzi at Peking University.
Jiang Hai asked:
"Is it Guan Zhong?" Tom

"Yes,"
"It is Guan Zhong,

'Jiang Hai said:'
'"What? You specialize in Chinese classics,
and you don't even know the story of 'The Old Horse Knows the Way,' which every Chinese person with a little common sense knows?" Thomson looked bewildered.
Jiang Hai told him the story and said:

To see the whole leopard through one spot.
When people analyze problems or evaluate a person,
Often, from words and deeds,
From bits and pieces of data or information,
One can basically deduce the development trend and outcome of a certain problem.
In 1938,
The situation in continental Europe is rapidly changing.
The threat of war is growing daily.
Hitler was clamoring to eliminate the socialist Soviet Union,
while stepping up preparations.
First, they expanded their aggression towards the West.
Faced with the aggressive momentum of fascist Germany,
England,
France, and other countries gave way repeatedly.
They were not preparing to resist Germany,
but were trying to entice Hitler to move east
to attack the Soviet Union,
waiting for the Soviet
Germany suffered heavy losses in the war,
while they reaped the benefits.
This is the infamous "blame-shifting" policy,
Therefore,
England,
France卑劣地屈从法西斯德国，(France卑劣地屈从法西斯德国)
signed the "Munich Agreement" that ceded the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia to Germany, dismembering Czechoslovakia.
In Europe and the world and
In a situation where peace was seriously threatened,
The socialist Soviet Union strived to take action
to prevent and combat Hitler's aggressive actions,
and maintain peace.
To this end, the Soviet Union to England,
France and France proposed,
Hold a tripartite meeting,
Establish a military alliance against Fascist Germany,
A joint war plan against Germany.
British,
Although the French government participated in the negotiations with the Soviet Union,
they were insincere,
and still harbored the intention of encouraging Germany to attack the Soviet Union
A 'scapegoat' that caused two potential enemies to perish together
118 h Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
The hidden motive of 'drawing the enemy eastward'.
The Three Kingdoms negotiations quickly reached a stalemate.
In this extremely grim situation.
The Communist Party of the Soviet Union saw that the British and
The French government insisted on pushing Germany onto the path of invading the Soviet Union,
If we still want to cooperate with Britain and
An alliance between France and Britain to resist Germany is now utterly impossible.
And for the Soviet Union to fight Germany alone,
would exact a heavy price under the current circumstances.
Stalin thoroughly analyzed the international situation,
He saw that,
although Hitler was extremely hostile to the Soviet regime,
he did not dare to take the risk of attacking first.
Hitler's plan was to expand westward first,
Defeat France,
England,
Dominate all of Western Europe,
And then turn around and attack the East.
Looking at the English,
the sinister intentions of the French government,
When the national security and interests of the Soviet Union were under significant threat, Stalin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided to exploit the intricate contradictions between imperialist countries
to extricate the Soviet Union from dire straits and danger.
Just at this moment,
Hitler had decided to implement the "White Plan" for the invasion of Poland; at the same time,
he also learned that Moscow was hosting British,
French,
Soviet-Three Kingdoms negotiations.
Hitler was deeply concerned,
He feared that once Britain,
France,
The Soviet Union formed an alliance with the Three Kingdoms.
He would be in a pincer position in future wars.
Moreover, he would find it difficult to implement his "White Plan".
Therefore,
Between May and August 1935, Hitler repeatedly expressed to the Soviet government, through his foreign minister,
that Germany had no intention of invading the Soviet Union,
and hoped to improve Soviet-
German relations
To make Soviet-German relations
stable and
normalized.
By August 20,
Hitler was already impatient,
because September 1st was the day Germany would take action against Poland.
Hitler directly telegraphed Stalin,
requesting Soviet agreement for Ribbentrop to travel to the Soviet Union for talks and signing.
Just not long ago,
Japan provoked the Nomonhan Incident in the Far East,
and launched an attack on the Soviet Union;
While Germany,
The two fascists are negotiating to form
Chapter 5, Aspect 5:
Clarifying the Trend of the Problem 119
military alliance,
The Soviet Union faced the real danger of being attacked from both sides.
Under the various crises,
The Soviet government finally made a major decision:
Agreeing to Ribbentrop's visit to Moscow.
August 22, 1939,
Germany
Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, carrying Hitler's personal
full power certificate signed,
Possessing the same Soviet Union
The power to sign a non-aggression treaty
(effective immediately upon signing), and flew to
Moscow,
With Stalin and Molotov
held talks.
August 23,
The Soviet-German
The Non-Aggression Treaty was formally signed.
条
The treaty stipulates:
The contracting parties guarantee not to
Individually or jointly with other countries, inflict upon each other
To use force,
To commit aggression and attack;
缔
If one of the parties,
Is at war with a third country,
Neither Contracting Party shall support any third country;
Neither Contracting Party shall participate in any direct
or indirect state group against the other Contracting Party.
The treaty stipulates a validity period of 10 years.
The signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact
marked the complete bankruptcy of the British and
French policy of appeasing Germany and diverting its aggression eastward.
The Soviet Union avoided fighting Germany alone
On the contrary, war broke out between Britain, France, and Germany.
British,
France and the UK encouraged Germany to invade,
reaping the bitter fruit of their own doing,
To lift a stone only to drop it on one's own feet. (idiom: to shoot oneself in the foot)
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once highly praised this Soviet political and diplomatic strategy,
saying that it was a "complete failure" of British and
French foreign policy and diplomatic means.
The signing of the "Treaty" earned the Soviet Union 23 months of precious war preparation time.
It used this time to rapidly expand its military.
Accelerate the development of industry in the eastern regions.
Intensify the stockpiling of war materials
This was of great significance to the Soviet Union's victory in the war.
The signing of the "Treaty" also deepened the contradiction between Germany and Japan.
It broke the unified anti-Soviet and anti-Communist front between Germany and Japan.
Because Germany and Japan had agreed to jointly oppose the Soviet Union and support each other.
Just as Japan was launching an offensive against the Soviet Union in the Far East,
Germany surprisingly signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union,
which greatly undermined the Japanese fascists' plan to invade the Soviet Union.
The Japanese Hiranuma Cabinet was condemned.
He soon announced his resignation.
From then on,
The two fascist countries never marched in lockstep.
In June 1944, Germany invaded the Soviet Union.
Demanding Japan to

Cooperate with the eastern front operation,
But Japan was focused on advancing southward,
Attack on Pearl Harbor,
Disregarding the urgent appeals to Germany.
The politics and international politics at that time were extremely complex,
The lines between friend and foe were constantly changing.
Stalin accurately perceived the situation,
soberly recognized the essence of the problem,
and then changed strategies in a timely manner,
and took favorable measures,
Enabled the Soviet Union to win the war.

What is the world-renowned Delphi method used for?
It is an intuitive forecasting method.
Intuitive forecasting is the oldest forecasting method.
Since humans began to predict natural and social phenomena,
intuitive forecasting has been used extensively,
and still is today.
Intuitive forecasting is still the most used method.
1. History of the Delphi Method
The Delphi method is an intuitive forecasting method developed after World War II.
Delphi is a historical site in Greece.
Location of the Temple of Apollo.
Apollo has the ability to predict the future.
With the development of science and technology,
the scale of production expands,
Ancient intuitive forecasting methods often seem inadequate in predicting today's production technologies.
and social phenomena,
and accuracy cannot be guaranteed.
Therefore,
In the past 20 years,
People have studied various non-intuitive prediction methods.
Especially with the widespread application of high-speed electronic computers with large storage capacity,
It enables people to perform calculations with calculation speed and accuracy that the human brain cannot match.

Prediction.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s,
A craze for pursuing mathematical prediction emerged in the West:
In the mid-1960s,
governments and people in many countries were enthusiastic about establishing electronic computer data processing
systems.
However,
In practice, people have realized that
Intuitive forecasting methods still have strong vitality.
The human brain cannot be replaced by any computer.
Blindly and excessively pursuing digital prediction will lead management science to a dead end.
Even with faster,
more features,
and more automated electronic computers,
when encountering the following situations,
'Using human intuition for prediction is still unavoidable:'
unavoidable:
The amount of information that can be used as input is very small,
It is difficult for any computer prediction program to predict with such small amount of information:
Even with predictions,
the results are not reliable.
Generally speaking,
predictions using mathematical models,
The year the data is occupied should be equal to the year of look-ahead prediction,
or even greater than the year of look-ahead prediction.
However, this condition is often difficult to meet.
The amount of original information is extremely large,
Exceeded the storage capacity of the machine.
Many prediction problems require involving technology,
politics,
economics,
psychology,
make judgments based on many related factors such as cultural traditions.
For example, urban planning and construction have tens of thousands of variables,
computer processing such a large amount of information,
The cost is high.
According to statistics from some companies in the United States,
10% of the company's budget is used for electronic computer data processing.
This can cost millions of dollars.
It often results in more harm than good.
The required information is no longer available or is very costly to obtain.
Using mathematical models for prediction,
Generally, only the possible development of the technology itself can be considered.
122 Grasping the nine aspects of analyzing problems
Use past and present developments to deduce future development trends.
It must assume that no unexpected events will occur under boundary conditions.
Therefore,
It is insensitive to changes in political,
social factors,
policy impacts, and other conditions.
In these occasions,
It seems difficult for computers to make predictions.
People have to rely on intuitive forecasting techniques.
Since the 1970s,
people have begun to value the role of human wisdom in prediction.
The Delphi method has been re-developed under such historical conditions.
2. The Prediction Process of the Delphi Method
The Delphi method utilizes the knowledge of experts,
experience,
Information that is difficult to quantify, such as wisdom, and has great ambiguity,
Exchange information through communication,
Gradually reach a more consistent opinion,
So as to achieve the purpose of prediction.
In general,
The implementation of the Delphi method requires some organizational work as a foundation.
First, there should be a management team,
ranging from two to a dozen people.
Depends on the workload.
The management team should have a correct understanding of the essence and process of the Delphi method,
Understand the situation of the experts,
Possess the necessary professional knowledge,
Master certain statistics,
data processing and other methods.
After the management team had a general design of the process of using the Delphi method for prediction,
select a list of experts.
Usually,
The management team has a list of available experts,
From which to select experts to participate in the forecast,
To form a response team,
With a number ranging from a dozen to one or two hundred.
Expert situation

Different,

Position,
Personality,
Differences in social background, etc.,
These will all affect their understanding of a particular issue,
affecting their answers,
affecting the outcome of predictions.
Therefore,
Carefully study the selection of the response team list,
So that the structure of this group is sufficient to have a comprehensive consideration of the research questions,
Without omitting important information.
For this reason,
The list should include experts from various disciplines related to the topic.
It should also include experts from other disciplines.
It is best to include a few people who are good at interdisciplinary thinking.
Or those who like to argue.
People who like to ask questions.
People who ask questions.
The experts to be invited should obtain consent in advance,
otherwise the recovery rate will be too low.
Even less than 50%.
The Delphi method is a controlled process for organized collective thought exchange,
where a group of many different experts collectively solves a complex problem as a whole.
It has the following characteristics:
(1) Respondents have some degree of anonymity.
Although the solicitation form can be non-anonymous,
the solicitation and response must be conducted "back-to-back,"
Respondents only know the tendency of all experts when the information is fed back.
He doesn't know the specific individual's answer, nor does he know who made the reply.
In this way,
A particular response will not be due to authority,
qualifications,
talent, or other reasons "impact" the collective exchange of information.
(2) Establishing collective judgments and insights on the basis of statistical evaluation.
(3) The elicited responses are statistically processed,
and fed back to the participating experts at least once,
so that everyone can know the distribution of collective responses and the reasons for dissenting opinions.
124 Grasping the nine aspects of analyzing problems
Reason.
(4) Each respondent has at least one opportunity to revise their opinion,
There are no other concerns arising from this.
(5) Problems can be handled with the aid of precise analysis techniques,
but intuitive judgments based on a collective foundation can yield some useful results.
6.
Brainstorming: Who is creating the storm?
Brainstorming, also known as expert forecasting,
It relies on the creative logical thinking of experts
to obtain future information.
It can be divided into two categories:
The method of obtaining future information through creative thinking by means of an individual expert's 'micro-intelligent structure' is called the individual judgment prediction method.
Also known as the individual brainstorming method.
One is based on the collective 'macro-intelligent structure' (through the exchange of information between experts' 'micro-intelligent structures' to inspire each other,
causing 'thinking resonance' and complementing each other.
Generate a combination effect,
forming a macro intelligent structure), the method of obtaining future information through creative logical thinking is called the expert "conference" method,
or called a collec-
tive brainstorming method.
Group brainstorming methods can be further divided into direct brainstorming and questioning brainstorming.
The former involves discussing specific issues together.
Leveraging the collective intelligence of the macro structure.

Bulk effect,
A group expert assessment for creative thinking activities,
Prediction method.
'Questioning brainstorming is a method of holding two expert meetings simultaneously.'
'It is a method of collectively generating ideas.'
'The first meeting strictly follows the principles of direct brainstorming.'
'The second meeting questions the assumptions put forward by the first meeting.'
Expert forecasting mainly involves experts in various fields of an organization.
They use their professional knowledge and experience.
Based on the external environment of the forecasting problem (social environment,
natural environment).
Through intuitive induction,
regarding the past of the prediction problem,
present,
the motion of the prediction problem,
Change,
The laws of development,
So as to make judgments on the future development trend and state of the prediction problem.
Therefore,
These experts should possess considerable academic proficiency not only in the specific prediction problem,
but also in related disciplines.
They should also possess the ability to see the "essence" of problems in a large amount of perceptual data (i.e., from a large number of real-world random phenomena,
to grasp the unchanging laws).
Find some correlation between them,
​so as to be able to make judgments about the future).
1. Personal Judgment Forecasting Method
Personal judgment forecasting refers to a judgment made by relying on experts' personal analysis of the future development trend and situation of the forecasting method problem.
The so-called expert,
is essentially a kind of individual "intelligent structure".
Therefore,
the biggest characteristic of the expert's individual judgment prediction method is that it can maximize the effect of the expert's individual intelligence structure.
Make full use of personal creativity.
This method,
For the experts whose opinions are being sought,
Unaffected by the external environment,
No psychological pressure.
126 - Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
However,
Personal judgment methods are often limited by the individual intellectual structure of the expert.
'i.e., restricted by the breadth of expert knowledge,'
depth of knowledge,
the amount of information possessed,
and factors such as the level of interest in the prediction problem.
It is inevitably one-sided.
2. Group brainstorming method
Compared with individual judgment method,
The expert conference method has the following significant characteristics:
(1) Expert meetings can leverage the intelligent structural effect of a group composed of many experts,
which is often greater than the sum of the individual creative abilities of each member of the group.
(2) Through information exchange among multiple experts, "thought resonance" can be generated, which can maximize creative thinking,
and it is possible to obtain fruitful creative results in a relatively short period of time.
(3) The amount of information in an expert meeting
is always greater than the amount of information possessed by a single member.
(4) The factors considered in an expert meeting
are always more than the factors considered by a single member.
(5) The issues raised by the expert meeting
are more specific and
comprehensive than those raised by a single member.
However,
Expert meetings also have shortcomings.
For example,
Sometimes psychological factors have a greater impact.
Easily succumbs to authority or the opinions of the majority.
While ignoring the opinions of the minority.
Sometimes minority opinions.
or the opinions of lesser-known people are correct;
susceptible to persuasive influences,
and unwilling to easily change opinions they have already expressed, etc.
Therefore,
When using brainstorming to organize expert meetings,
The following principles should also be followed:
Chapter Five, Aspect Five:
Understand the trend of the problem 127
① Strictly limit the scope of prediction problems.
Facilitates participants to focus on the issues involved.
② Seriously consider and study any hypothesis put forward by the expert group.
Regardless of whether the hypothesis is appropriate and feasible.
Do not question the opinions of others.
③ Encourage participants to supplement the ideas that have already been put forward.
Improvement and synthesis.
④Relieve participants of
ideological concerns,
create an atmosphere of free expression of opinions.
Atmosphere,
motivates participants.
(5) Strive for brevity and conciseness in speeches,
no detailed elaboration is needed.
Prolonging the speaking time will hinder the progress of creative thinking activities.
Participants are not allowed to read prepared speeches.
In order to provide a good creative thinking environment,
It is necessary to determine the optimal number of experts and the duration of the meeting.
Practice shows.
The size of the expert panel
should generally be 10-15 people,
and the meeting time should be 20-60 minutes for the best results.
The candidates for the expert meeting should be selected according to the following three principles:
① If the participants know each other,
Select from personnel in the same position (title or level).
Leaders should not participate.
Otherwise, it may put some pressure on the participants.
If the participants do not know each other,
People from different positions (titles or levels) can be selected.
At this time, the titles or levels of the participants should not be announced.
Regardless of the member's title
128 h Grasp the nine aspects of problem analysis
or level,
all should be treated equally.
Participants should strive to have expertise consistent with the issues in the predicted field being discussed.
Of course,
this is not a necessary condition for expert panel members.
The expert panel should also ideally include some people with broad common sense
Experts in other fields who have a deep understanding of the issues discussed.
The speech of the "brainstorming" leader should stimulate the participants' "inspiration" and make them feel the urgent need to answer the questions raised at the meeting.
Usually,
At the beginning of "brainstorming,"
Leaders must take a forceful questioning approach.
This is because leaders rarely have the opportunity to create an atmosphere of free exchange of opinions within the first 5 to 10 minutes of a meeting.
And to stimulate participants to speak actively.
The leader's proactive activities are also limited to the beginning of the meeting.
Once the participants are motivated,
New ideas will emerge continuously.
At this time,
The leader only needs to provide appropriate guidance based on the principles of "brainstorming".
Therefore,
the more one speaks,
the more diverse the opinions,
and the broader and deeper the issues discussed
The more valuable ideas that emerge.
Ideas presented at the meeting should be recorded on tape,
so that no idea is missed.
The analysis group systematically processes the ideas generated by the meeting.
For use in the next phase.
The systematic processing procedures are as follows:
① Compile a list of names for all proposed ideas.
② Describe the main points of each idea in common terms.
③ Identify redundant and complementary assumptions,
and form comprehensive assumptions based on them.
④ Propose assumptions
Chapter Five, Aspect Five:
Clarify the trend of the problem. Egg 129
Criteria for evaluation.
⑤ Group preparation of the assumption list.
3. Questioning brainstorming in the problem prediction process
,
Questioning brainstorming is also often used.
This method
is to question the systematized assumptions put forward by direct brainstorming.
Question the assumptions,
A specialized process within brainstorming methods for evaluating the feasibility of assumptions.
In this process,
第
one stage is to require participants.
Question every proposed idea,
and conduct a comprehensive review.
The focus of the review
is to investigate the problems that hinder the realization of the idea.
During the questioning process,
some feasible new ideas may arise,
These feasible new ideas,
including arguments that the proposed ideas cannot be implemented,
Existing limiting factors,
and suggestions for eliminating limiting factors.
Feasible new conceptual structures,
are usually:
"The ×× assumption is not feasible,"
Because ...
…
If it is to be made feasible,
It must ...
…
"
Questioning the results of the second stage of brainstorming,
is to create a review list for each group or each assumption,
and also add a list of feasible assumptions.
Also add a list of viable assumptions.
Questioning the principles that brainstorming should follow is the same as direct brainstorming.
It's just that
positive opinions on existing ideas are prohibited,
while encouraging the proposal of new and feasible ideas.
When conducting a questioning brainstorming session,
the leader should first briefly introduce the content of the problem being discussed,
and concisely introduce the assumptions of each system and the common assumptions of the first group,
in order to focus the participants' attention on a comprehensive evaluation of the problem.
The questioning process continues until there are no more questions to ask.
All evaluation opinions raised in the questioning and
Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
Feasible assumptions,
It should also be recorded on tape.
The third stage of questioning brainstorming evaluation,
is to evaluate the evaluation opinions raised during the questioning process,
in order to form a final list of ideas that are actually feasible for solving the problem under discussion.
Evaluating feedback is as important as questioning the assumptions being discussed.
Equally important is questioning the assumptions in the discussion.
Because during the questioning phase,
the focus is on studying all the limiting factors that hinder the implementation of the assumptions.
These limiting factors are given important consideration even in the ideation phase.
The analysis group is responsible for handling and
analyzing the results of the questioning.
The analysis group should include some experts who are capable of making more accurate judgments about the feasibility of the assumptions.
Participate.
When an analysis of major issues needs to be made in a very short period of time,
Absorb these.
It is especially important to have experts participate.
Practical experience shows that
Brainstorming can eliminate compromise problems,
Objectively addressing the issue through
continuous analysis,
A set of practical and feasible problems can be found,
Therefore, brainstorming has been widely used in military and civil forecasting in recent years.
For example, when the US Department of Defense formulated long-term technology plans,
50 experts were invited to hold a two-week meeting using brainstorming.
The participants' task is to challenge the long-term plans put forward in advance.
Through discussion,
to obtain a report that makes the original planning document consistent and harmonious,
in the original planning document,
Only 25% to 30% of the opinions are retained.
This shows the value of brainstorming.
The Delphi method is used to solicit expert opinions,
which often requires expert meetings.
这
Chapter Five, Aspect Five:
Understanding the Trend of the Problem 131
Although this method has certain advantages,
it also has some inherent drawbacks.
That is,
① The number of people attending expert meetings is always limited,
and the representation is not comprehensive.
② The influence of authority is relatively large.
Often, as soon as an authority expresses an opinion,
others follow their line of thinking and express their opinions,
or are afraid to express different opinions due to personal relationships.
③Easily influenced by expression ability.
People with good verbal communication skills,
are able to concisely and
persuasively present their arguments,
even though these arguments may not actually be
Other expert opinions.
Even when they know their opinions are inadequate or even wrong,
they are often unwilling to publicly revise their views,
thus leading to a stalemate in the meeting.
Easily influenced by "trendy" ideas.
A new insight often means changing a common view that has been accepted by most people.
People who express this new insight often become the minority who are out of step with the "trend" at the meeting.
This meeting method often doubts and then negates a new "unorthodox" point of view.
In reality, these new perspectives are often quite valuable.

For example, using a ten-level rating scale), and also investigating and confirming some basic answers expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the current situation and opportunities for improvement.
Grasping the key to the problem is a basic requirement.
Any organization other than large groups
What organization,
This investigation can only be seen as further confirmation of what you already know.
But even the best analysts have blind spots.
Therefore,
investigation is also a necessary means.
Training 2:
Value Time
Practice time:
1 minute
Number of uses:
Regularly
A traditional, dispiriting practice,
that affects everyone,
which is not valuing other people's time.
For example,
You ask someone immediately
Chapter Five, Aspect Five:
The tendency to fill up problems 133
To undertake a task that is not urgent,
Just because you want to get it done:
You call a group meeting,
And allow them to ramble aimlessly all afternoon:
You invited hundreds of people to the product launch,
and then made them wait in the conference hall with just a cup of coffee,
waiting anxiously,
before announcing the start of the meeting almost an hour after the scheduled time.
It's all too commonplace,
All the examples clearly demonstrate that you are disregarding other people's time.
If that's the case, then how should it be handled? Don't assume you have priority in taking up other people's time.
For example,
When calling someone,
don't start by rambling on about unrelated things,
or saying unimportant things.
Instead, ask if they have a minute or two to spare first
Be mindful of other people's schedules.
schedule,
Also, use good meeting time management practices to avoid wasting time during meetings.
If the information is
After the announcement is finished,
don't leave a whole room of people there doing nothing.
The meeting should be adjourned.
If possible,
You can organize some activities,
Do things that interest them,
But it has to be just right,
So that people don't feel like they're wasting time.
If you don't value what others value,
especially if you don't value basic things like time,
then you won't be able to get their understanding and support.
Training 3:
Define appropriate tasks
Practice time:
10 minutes
Usage count:
Once in a while
If your boss assigns you work that is exactly what you want to do and are suited to do,
then you will be easily inspired in the process of working.
You can start by listing all the work you are currently doing,
indicating which tasks you are willing to continue doing.
Which jobs do you want to give up?
Then add another column.
List the new jobs you want to start immediately and create a work plan with your dream expectations.
Secondly,
Put this task list aside,
Think carefully about your own skills and talents,
What are you really good at? Do you think you need appropriate training? Make a list of skills,
And according to the requirements of this skill list,
Remove jobs from your dream job list that you lack the skills for.
Finally,
Use this curated list of tasks,
Compare with the current job.
Tasks that are not listed in the task book but you need to do,
Can they be listed elsewhere? Are there any that haven't started yet,
But do they really match the work tasks listed in the task book? Don't make any major changes yet,
Instead, look for some immediate work tasks
When the time is right in the future,
make larger adjustments.
This is an interesting exercise,
if you can apply it in your actual work,
Then there will be a great working effect.
However,
Attention should be paid to the gap between ideals and real work,
Do not ignore this gap,
To narrow this gap through one's own efforts,
thereby solving the problem well.
Chapter Six
Aspect Six:
Understand your capacity to solve this type of problem
136 h Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
Problem analysis is both a science
and an art.
Without certain qualities and abilities,
it is impossible to grasp the subtleties and nuances involved,
nor is it possible to handle the various practical problems that arise in real life perfectly.
1
Good communication skills are essential for analyzing problems.
Problem analysis is inseparable from communication.
Without communication,
it is difficult to sort out the various relationships related to the problem.
So,
a person's ability to analyze problems,
is also reflected in their communication skills to a certain extent.
Chapter 6: Clarify your ability reserves for solving such problems 137
1. Analyze the problem to convince people with reason
To convince people with reason,
is to convince people by presenting the facts,
and reasoning.
To make people agree with one's own views and propositions,
and to achieve the most effective communication between each other,
so as to achieve the purpose of analyzing problems.
In 1936,
After the "Xi'an Incident" occurred,
Some of Yang Hucheng's officers strongly demanded that Chiang Kai-shek be killed.
Comrade Zhou Enlai, in order to realize our Party's political proposition of "peacefully resolving the Xi'an Incident"
and to achieve the goal of "forcing Chiang to resist Japan,"
Reach out to these officers to persuade them.
Comrade Zhou Enlai said to them:
"It's easy to kill him,
a word is enough."
But what if he is killed? What will happen to the situation? What will the Japanese do? What about the future of the country and the nation? Have you all thought about it? This time, Chiang Kai-shek was captured,
It's different from capturing Kerensky in the October Revolution,
It's different from capturing Napoleon at Waterloo.
The former is the result of the victory of the revolution,
The latter is the tragedy of Napoleon's military defeat.
What about now? Yu Ran captured Chiang Kai-shek,
but did not eliminate his power.
Driven by the upsurge of national resistance against Japan,
Add British customs
Also advocated for a peaceful resolution to the Xi'an Incident.
Therefore, it was possible to force Chiang to resist Japan.
We must love our country.
It is necessary to consider the interests of the country and the nation,
and not to dwell on personal feuds.
”
Comrade Zhou Enlai's remarks use the method of giving examples and asking questions.
He first used a sentence to stabilize the officer's heart,
Controlled the situation:
Then used six consecutive questions,
Stimulated and guided the officers to think deeply,
Finally, the goal and proposition of "forcing Chiang to resist Japan" were put forward.
Three levels,
each level closely linked to the next,
each level deeper than the last,
understanding it through reason,
Guide them with emotions,
Finally made these "a scene of killing
138 Grasping the nine aspects of analyzing problems
You and I are a pair of contradictions.
In "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," there is a story of "Lu Bu being executed at the White Gate Tower."
Lu Bu was captured by Cao Cao.
Cao Cao considered Lu Bu's great ability,
so he intended to spare his life.
Keep him for our own use.
Therefore,
He sought Liu Bei's opinion.
Liu Bei worried that if Lü Bu surrendered to Cao Cao,
it would be detrimental to his own ambition to dominate the world in the future.
He hoped that Cao Cao would execute Lü Bu.
At this time,
Liu Bei could have listed many of Lü Bu's misdeeds,
But he only chose Lü Bu's ruthlessness,
and ingratitude,
To persuade Cao Cao, he cited the typical example of personally killing his adoptive father.
Liu Bei only said:
"You
haven't you seen Ding Jianyang?"
"Is this about Dong Zhuo?" One sentence,
reminded Zeng Cao of Lu Bu's fickleness,
making it difficult for him to become a trusted aide,
and possibly making one a victim of Lu Bu's blade.
And so,
Cao Cao made up his mind
to execute Lü Bu immediately.
Cao Cao was no ordinary person.
The reason why Liu Bei was able to persuade Cao Cao
The key was to seize the fatal typical examples,
And pointed out the key points,
Completely changed Cao Cao's original plan.
The above two examples use specific instances to persuade the other party.
Thereby achieving the purpose of analyzing the problem.
Here's another example of persuading someone using a metaphor:
Emperor Taizong of Tang wanted to expand the army,
He wanted to enlist all middle-aged men who were not subject to conscription into the army.
Prime Minister Wei Zheng, upon learning of this, said to him:
"If you drain the ditches,"
it's not that you won't get any fish,
But there probably won't be any fish next year;
Burned the forest down,
It's not that we can't hunt wild animals,
But next year
Chapter 6, Aspect 6: Clarify your ability reserves for solving this type of problem = 139
Then there would be no beasts to hunt.
If all middle-aged men are recruited into the army,
What about production? Where will taxes be collected? It's not about quantity, but quality.
The key is whether they are well-trained,
and effectively commanded.
Why seek more?
"Taizong was speechless,"
Had to withdraw the order.
In this paragraph,
Wei Zheng used two similar examples related to the main event for comparison.
It vividly and profoundly explained the reason why middle-aged men should not all be transferred to the army.
Extremely persuasive.
2. Analyze problems with emotion
People have feelings.
When analyzing problems,
We must not only convince the other party rationally,
but also influence them emotionally,
and achieve resonance with them.
That is, start from the other party's perspective.
Try your best to understand the other party,
and then through your own language,
actions,
affect the other party with expressions and attitudes,
In an effort to gain the other party's understanding or sympathy.
It is said that one cold winter,
on a bustling street in New York,
there was a person with both eyes
A blind beggar.
The beggar had a sign around his neck,
which read:
"Blind from birth."
One day,
A poet approached him,
He begged the poet.
The poet said:
"I am also very poor, but I will give you something else." After saying that,
He then casually wrote a sentence on the beggar's sign.
That day,
The beggar received a lot of sympathy and alms from people. Later,
He met the poet again,
Asked strangely:
"What did you write for me?" The poet smiled,
and read from the sign
140 The nine aspects of ultra-analysis problems
The sentence he wrote:
"Spring is coming,
but I can't see it.
”
Why were the words "blind from childhood" replaced with the similar sentiment "Spring is coming,
"But if I can't see it," wouldn't the beggar receive more sympathy and alms? This is precisely because the latter
not only implicitly contains the unfortunate fact of "blindness,"
but also expresses the beggar's desire to see spring like the pedestrians on the street.
People basking in the spring breeze on the street see this heartfelt soliloquy,
Naturally, one would think of their own good fortune,
and thus feel deep sympathy for the beggar's misfortune.
The poet's brilliance lies in knowing how to win the sympathy of passersby on the street.
This strategy of moving people with emotion,
It can also be used in litigation or other areas.
Before Lincoln was the President of the United States,
he used to be a lawyer.
Once, he encountered such a thing:
An old woman found Lincoln.
She was the widow of a martyr from the Revolutionary War.
She lived on a pension every month.
But the cashier demanded that she pay a fee before allowing her to collect the money
And this handling fee was equivalent to half of the pension.
The old woman asked Lincoln to appeal for her.
The court is in session.
The plaintiff alleges
The defendant's extortionate behavior,
The defendant denied it due to insufficient evidence.
The situation seemed unfavorable to the plaintiff.
How to reverse the situation? It was Lincoln's turn to speak.
He used a melodious and tactful tone,
First, he brought the audience back to the arduous and outstanding fighting life of the American Revolutionary War.
Suddenly,
He became emotional,
The words pointed directly at the cashier who attempted to blackmail the martyr's widow. Finally,
he said with passion:
"Now the facts have become relics.
The heroes of 1776,
Long since laid to rest.
Chapter 6, Aspect 6. Clarify your capacity reserves for solving this type of problem 141
Under,
But their old and pitiful widow,
Still in front of us,
Asking to appeal on her behalf.
Needless to say,
This old woman was once a beautiful girl,
She once had a happy and joyful family life.
However,
she has sacrificed everything,
and become poor and destitute.
had to ask us for help and protection.
May I ask,
can we turn a blind eye to it?
The audience was moved by Lincoln's words.
Unanimously condemn that cashier,
demanding that the court pass a judgment protecting the widows of martyrs from extortion.
The old woman won the case.
The widows of war martyrs already lead difficult lives,
The cashier still gouged her for a high handling fee,
This is indeed infuriating.
In court,
Lincoln did not discuss at length whether charging a handling fee itself was reasonable,
Instead, it adopted a strategy of moving people with emotions.
It emotionally recounts the war that caused the old woman to lose her husband.
Guiding people into that era of war and chaos.
Allowing people to imagine the old woman's youth and beauty in those years
and the great sacrifices she made for victory in the war.
Looking back,
Compared to today,
Creates a strong sense of resonance in people,
Making it impossible not to feel a special sympathy for the old woman's misfortune.

Personal attack,
We firmly demand a public apology from Mark Twain,
Otherwise, we will resort to legal means to sue him for defamation.
Faced with the collective siege by members of Congress,
After calm consideration, Mark Twain
An 'apology announcement' was published in The New York Times to federal congressmen: 'Recently, I made a statement while answering reporters' questions at a reception,
saying that 'some members of the United States Congress are sons of bitches.'
Afterward, someone came to me to question my actions.
After much consideration,
I don't think this is appropriate,
and it's not true.
Therefore, I hereby issue a statement in the newspaper,
and revise my words as follows:
'In the United States Congress,'
'some congressmen are not sons of bitches."'
'After this "apology statement" was published,'
'the uproar suddenly subsided.'
It is not difficult to see that,
The previous sentence said "some are," but because it did not specify who was,
every council member felt threatened.
Later, it was changed to "some are not," and naturally, all the council members believed that they were not.
Why bother to pester again?
Isn't that just asking for trouble? Only by thinking about and dealing with problems with a calm mind,
can you come up with ingenious solutions.
2. Peaceful emotions
In real life,
the emergence of many problems
is unexpected.
The more this is the case,
The more you need a peaceful mood,
to be able to face things calmly,
is the effective way to analyze problems.
Because only with a peaceful mind,
Only then can you maintain a calm mind.
Only by thinking calmly,
can you make corresponding and appropriate decisions,
so that the problem can be properly resolved.
Emperor Gaozu of Han returned from the army that was sent to punish Chen Xi,

"Han Xin said he regretted not adopting Kuai Tong's plan."
"Emperor Gaozu said:"
'"That fellow is a lobbyist from the state of Qi."'
"So he ordered that Kuai Tong be arrested in the Qi territory."
After Kuai Tong was arrested,
The Emperor asked:
'"Did you instigate the Marquis of Huaiyin to rebel?" Kuai Tong replied:'
"Yes,"
I did teach him that in the first place.
That kid didn't take my advice,
so he brought ruin upon himself,
and ended up in this state.
If only that kid had taken

"“Boil him to death!” Kuai Tong said,"
'"I am truly wronged!" said the Emperor.'
said:
"You incited Han Xin to rebel,
what grievance do you have?" Kuai Tong replied:
"In the beginning, the laws and institutions of the Qin Dynasty deteriorated."
The regime disintegrated.
The Shandong region was in great chaos.
Heroes and valiant individuals rose up in great numbers.
The Qin Dynasty lost its imperial power,
and heroes and talents all over the world rose up to pursue it.
Those who were highly skilled,

Robber Zhi's dog barked wildly at Tang Yao,
It's not that Tang Yao is unkind,
It's just because he's not the dog's owner.

Yuchi Jingde relied on his merits and became arrogant and indulgent.
Overbearing and arrogant,
Resulting in dissatisfaction among colleagues.
Someone once accused him of treason.
After Li Shimin found out,
Asked Yuchi Jingde if it was true,
Jingde said:
"Your臣 followed Your Majesty to conquer all sides,
Having experienced hundreds of battles.
Now the survivors are,
Only those who escaped from under the swords and arrows.
The world is already settled,
'"Instead, you suspect that your subjects will rebel?" Saying this, he took off his clothes and threw them on the ground.'
Exposing the numerous scars on his body, Li Shimin was so moved that tears streamed down his face.
He comforted him with kind words.
But Jingde's arrogance remained unchanged.
One day,
At a banquet held by Emperor Taizong, Yuchi Jingde argued with others about who was the elder.
A fire broke out for a moment.
He beat up Li Daoxong, the Prince of Rencheng.
And blinded one of Daoxong's eyes.
Looking up, seeing Jingde being so presumptuous,
He was very displeased and stopped the actual event.

"I want to share wealth and honor with you,
However, you are arrogant in your official position,
And have repeatedly violated the law.
Do you know why Han Xin and Peng Yue were killed in ancient times?

while Emperor Daizong of Tang dealt with a family quarrel between his daughter and son-in-law,
Then he would be even better than others.
Emperor Daizong of the Tang Dynasty married his daughter, Princess Shengping, to Guo Ai, the son of Guo Ziyi.
Once, Guo Ai had a quarrel with the princess.
The princess was not willing to be outdone.
Guo Nuan said:
"You rely on your father being the emperor,
I don't even want to be the emperor.
"The princess was furious when she heard this,
He quickly took a carriage back to the palace to tell his father.
Emperor Daizong of Tang rebuked Princess Shengping after hearing this, saying:
"The rationale behind this
is beyond your understanding."
His father was in charge of the military power of our dynasty.
If he wanted to be the emperor, he could have become one easily.
"How can you take words spoken in anger between husband and wife seriously?" Then he comforted the princess for a while,
and sent her back home.
When Guo Ziyi heard about this,
he had Guo Ai tied up
and brought him to the court to plead guilty.
When Emperor Daizong saw this,
said:
"There's a saying among the people:
'Without some foolishness, there's no seniority,

Yi Geng, Secretary of the Shekou Industrial Zone Party Committee in Shenzhen,
In foreign-related economic activities,
Good at negotiating with foreign businessmen.
Once,
Yuan Qing visited a certain country,
and negotiated with a certain consortium,
to jointly operate a new type of float glass factory in the Shekou Industrial Zone. The other party, relying on its advanced technology and equipment,
demanded an exorbitant price from our side.
The negotiation reached a standstill.
One day,
The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, where a certain consortium is located, invited Yuan Geng to give a speech.
Yuan Geng gladly went there.
He was giving a speech when,
Said meaningfully:
"China is an ancient civilization,"
Our ancestors, more than a thousand years ago,
Already made
Great Inventions—
—
Compass,
Papermaking,
Printing,
The gunpowder production technology was unconditionally contributed to mankind,
and their descendants never complained that it was foolish of them not to have patent rights;
Conversely,
but praised their ancestors for making outstanding contributions to the advancement of world science.
Now;
In its economic cooperation with other countries, China
does not require countries to unconditionally relinquish patent rights.
As long as the price is reasonable,
we will not give a penny less..
…
"
Yuan Geng's neither obsequious nor arrogant brilliant speech,
won warm applause from the participants,
and also prompted the consortium in subsequent negotiations,
to be willing to reduce patent fees and cooperate with it,
By both parties
-
'148 = Using nine aspects of interesting analysis to solve problems, this led to a cooperation project worth nearly 100 million US dollars.'

was when the other party relied on its advanced technological equipment,
Delivered when he was making exorbitant demands.
The speech was delivered with a humble yet firm attitude.
The speech was well-reasoned and supported by evidence.
Facing an opponent who was arrogant and aggressive due to their advanced technology,
Showed a dignified and steady temperament,
Demonstrated the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation.
4. Broad-mindedness
Handling problems,
One must have a broad mind.
On this point,
Whether it is towards relatives,
or towards friends,
We should be tolerant of strangers and even enemies when it is time to be tolerant.
Forgive and forget whenever you can.
An analogy.
One of Lord Mengchang's retainers had an affair with Lord Mengchang's wife.
Someone couldn't stand it anymore,
So they told Lord Mengchang about it:
"As one of your close confidants,
he is secretly having an affair with your wife,"
That's really disloyal.
Please kill him.
"Lord Mengchang said:
"When people see someone with a beautiful appearance, they naturally like them,
It's human nature.
Let's put this matter aside for now,
Let's not talk about it.
”
Chapter 6: Clarify your ability reserves for solving such problems.
A year passed,
Lord Mengchang summoned the man who had been having an affair with his wife and said to him:
"You have been in my place for a long time,
but you haven't obtained a high position
You, petty official, don't want to do your job again.
The ruler of Wei is a good friend of mine.
I have prepared carriages and horses for you,
leather clothes and the edge of a garment.
I hope you go to the State of Wei,
"and serve the ruler of the State of Wei." As a result,
this person went to the State of Wei and was highly valued.
An ancient saying goes:
The hatred of killing one's father,
The resentment of seizing one's wife,
Are irreconcilable.
Yet Lord Mengchang was able to tolerate the man who stole his wife,
Its measure can be described as great! However,
things are applied appropriately,
and there are also corresponding returns.
Later, the State of Qi,
The relationship with the State of Wei deteriorated.
The ruler of Wei wanted to unite the feudal lords to attack the State of Qi.
The man who had an affair with Lord Mengchang's wife said to the ruler of Wei:
"Lord Mengchang doesn't know that I am an incompetent person.
They actually recommended me to you.
I heard that the former kings of Qi and
Wei,
used to slaughter horses and sheep,
Took an oath saying:
'The descendants of Qi and
Wei shall not attack each other.
If anyone attacks each other,
Their fate is the same as that of cattle and sheep.
If you unite the troops of the feudal lords to attack the State of Qi,
This is you violating the covenant of the late king,
and deceiving Lord Mengchang.
I hope you will give up your plan to attack the State of Qi.
It would be best if you listen to my advice,
But if you don't listen to my advice,
Someone as worthless as me,
I am willing to splatter your clothes with my ardent blood.
Under his persuasion and threats, Wei Jun
finally did not attack the State of Qi.
If Lord Mengchang had listened to others and killed the man who was having an affair with his wife,
Who else can stand up and stop Wei from attacking Qi? It seems that Lord Mengchang's tolerance moved the man who had an affair with his wife,
So this person risked his life to advise him.

He said with a slight worry:
"If Hu Zongnan is smart,

If it's something foolish,
it will definitely come.
If he really doesn't come,
I'll have to find a way to invite him.
The purpose of bringing Hu Zongnan in was

Analyzing problems by using emotional persuasion,
means that the persuader uses a certain emotional relationship of the other party as a starting point,
and then further expands the ideas,
from the superficial to the profound,
Induce the other party by analogy,
Influence the other party with emotion,
So as to achieve the purpose of analyzing the problem.

The following year,
the Qin state attacked the Zhao state.
'They captured three cities of Zhao in quick succession,'
The situation was extremely critical.
Zhao was left with no choice but to
seek help from Qi.
A man of Qi said:
"We must use Lord Changan (the youngest son of the Zhao Dowager Queen,
Lord Changan is his title) as a hostage,
only then can we send troops."
"The Empress Dowager didn't agree."
The ministers strongly remonstrated.
The Empress Dowager became impatient.
She said to the ministers beside her:
"If anyone mentions sending Chang'an Jun to the State of Qi as a hostage again,"
this old woman will definitely spit in his face!
Zuo Shi Chulong said he wished to see the Empress Dowager Zhao,
The Empress Dowager was waiting for him, fuming with anger.
Touch Dragon first said that he had problems with his legs and feet and could not walk fast.
Please forgive the Queen Dowager.
Then he inquired about the Queen Dowager's diet and daily life.
The Queen Dowager's anger subsided a lot.
Then he said to the Empress Dowager:
"I have a son named Shuqi,
He is the youngest and yet hopeless.
I am old and useless,
I feel very sorry for him.
I hope to arrange for him to be a palace guard,
to contribute to the defense of the palace.
I want to entrust him to you before I get into my coffin,
To witness this being accomplished with my own eyes
is extremely fortunate."
The Empress Dowager smiled and said,
"Do men also love their youngest sons?" Chu Long replied,
"Even more formidable"
than a woman.
"The Empress Dowager did not show weakness,"
and said:
"No,"
The woman is even more formidable.
"Chulong said:"
"I think you love your daughter, the Queen of Yan, more than Chang'an Jun." The Empress Dowager said:
"You're wrong,"
It's not as deep as the love
Lord Chang'an's love.
"Chulong said:"
"Parents love their children,"
They should make long-term plans for them.
When the Empress Dowager sent her daughter to be married,
She cried and sobbed,
This is because the thought of her marrying far away from home,
makes me feel sorry for her.
After marrying into that family,
it's not that she won't miss home.
But during the sacrifice, they prayed:
'Even if you miss home,
you must not let her return.' Isn't this a long-term plan,
hoping for the descendants of Queen Yan?
Theologians cannot answer this question.
If God can create this stone,
then how can a God who cannot even lift this stone be said to be omnipotent?
Conversely,
If God cannot create this stone,
then it also proves that God cannot be called omnipotent.
On the eve of the US presidential election,
the situation was very unfavorable for Lincoln.
His opponent, the Democratic candidate, was assured of votes in the Southern slave states.
As long as he won a few Northern states,
he could be assured of victory.
The Democratic candidate was Douglas.
If you want to defeat Douglas,
first you have to create discord within the Democratic Party.
So,
during a debate, Lincoln
He posed a challenging question to Douglas:
"Within the U.S. territories that are not states,
can the people lawfully exclude slavery from its limits?"
This was a very difficult question to answer.
If Douglas answered affirmatively,
he would lose the support of the Southern states.
If he answered in the negative,
he would lose the support of the Northern states.
Including his home state of Illinois.
Douglas, under pressure from Democrats in his home state,
Gave an affirmative answer.
Which angered Southern Democrats.
They decided to withdraw their support for Douglas and
form another party.
In this way,
the Democratic Party declared a split.
The Southern Democratic Party also selected its own candidate.

What is the ability of strategy?
Strategy,
is a word that people are very familiar with and admire.
Since ancient times,
how many people have devised ingenious plans,
To rack one's brains for good ideas,
And how many people have devoted their efforts to the implementation of ingenious plans,
Even heroically sacrificing themselves.
A long history of human development,
It is also a creation history of strategies and a practice history of strategies.
It sparkles with the sparks of human wisdom at all times and in all places.

To distinguish between them:
① He was criticized in the Central Soviet Area,
i.e., Deng,
Mao,
Xie,
one of the ancient four sinners,
is the head of the so-called Maoists.
Materials for rectifying him can be found in the Two-Line Struggle,
Two books since the Sixth National Congress.
The person who came forward to rectify him was Zhang Wentian.
②He has no historical problems,
i.e., he has never surrendered to the enemy. ③He was helpful in assisting Comrade Liu Bocheng in fighting battles.
Had military exploits.
Besides this,
After entering the city,
It's not like he didn't do anything good,
For example, leading a delegation to negotiate in Moscow,
He did not succumb to Soviet revisionism.
I have said these things many times,
I'll say it again now.
"
Mao Zedong's comment made a positive evaluation of Deng Xiaoping,
although this affirmation was based on the premise that Deng Xiaoping's "mistakes were serious,"
but Mao Zedong with absolute power
authority,
"Liberated" the "Number Two Capitalist Roader in China".
After being overthrown for seven years,
Deng Xiaoping's political fate took another major turn,
He left Nanchang, Jiangxi with his family—
—
They spent three and a half years of imprisonment there.
Returning to Beijing,
He resumed his Party organizational life and his position as Vice Premier of the State Council.
However,
Mao Zedong also wanted to entrust Deng Xiaoping with greater responsibilities.
December 12, 1973,
Mao Zedong presided over a meeting of the Political Bureau,
After raising the topic of exchanging commanders among all major military regions,
Mao Zedong announced an important decision:
"Now,
we have hired a strategist,
named Deng Xiaoping."
Sent
notice,
as a member of the Political Bureau,
Member of the Military Commission.
The Politburo is in charge of everything.
It covers the government, the military, the people, education, and all directions: east, west, south, north, and center.
I think the Politburo should add a Secretary-General.
You don't want this title.
"Then be a chief of staff." Mao Zedong continued:
"We have invited a chief of staff now."
And he,
Some people are afraid of him,
But he is quite decisive in his work.
His life is probably a 30/70 split.
Your old boss,
I've invited him back.
The Politburo has been invited back,
It wasn't just me who invited them back.
”
Mao Zedong then turned to Deng Xiaoping next to him and said:
"What about you?"
People are a little afraid of you.
Let me give you two pieces of advice:
Softness within strength,
A needle hidden in the binding
Be more amiable externally,
But internally, we are a steel company.
Past shortcomings,
Let's slowly correct them.
"
Mao Zedong took the opportunity to choose people,
Boldly employing Deng Xiaoping when the situation was extremely chaotic
It has to be said that this was a brilliant move.
During the period when Deng Xiaoping assisted Zhou Enlai in presiding over the work,
Rectified various aspects,
Emphasized grasping production,
Improved the national economy in all aspects,
And also redressed some unjust, false, and wrong cases
Released a group of veteran cadres to work,
Curbing the "Gang of Four's" attempt to usurp party and state power.
Mao Zedong's move to reinstate Deng Xiaoping
was clearly in line with the trend of history.
'2. Analyzing problems with the method of "using the opponent's strength against them"'
Using the opponent's strength against them,
is a strategy of analyzing problems by using external forces to strike the opponent.
There are mainly two situations for using the opponent's strength against them:
Firstly, one's own strength is insufficient,
and one wants to strike at the opponent,
so one has to find a way to borrow external force to achieve one's own purpose:
Secondly, one wants to strike or eradicate the opponent,
Still don't want the other party to know it was you who did it,
You have to borrow external forces to implement your plan.
In 262 BC,
The Qin army attacked the Shangdang area of South Korea.
South Korea is a small country,
powerless to resist,
and Shangdang was on the verge of collapse.
At this time, Feng Shi, the garrison general of Shangdang, came up with a clever idea.
Chapter Six, Aspect Six: Clarifying Yin to Build Capacity for Solving Such Problems, Part 1, 165
plan,
he sent an envoy to the Zhao state,
and said to King Xiaocheng of Zhao,
South Korea could not hold Shangdang,
and planned to surrender to the Qin State.
However, the Shangdang garrison and the people hated the King of Qin
and loved the King of Zhao
Therefore, Korea is willing to offer
seventeen towns in the Party region to the Zhao state.
King Xiaocheng of Zhao was very pleased to hear that Korea was willing to offer such a vast territory.
Very happy,
Immediately, Zhao Sheng was ordered to accept Feng Ting's 17 towns.
So,
An unprecedented large-scale battle took place between Qin and Zhao.
In Grimm's fairy tales,
there is a clever little tailor,
He was sent by the king to deal with two evil giants in the forest.
The little tailor couldn't defeat the two giants with strength,
but he couldn't disobey the king's order.
It seems,
Going is death,
Not going is also death,
What to do? The little tailor has his own tricks.
After he entered the forest,
Found two giants sleeping under a large tree.
So he picked up many stones and climbed up the tree.
The little tailor threw stones from the tree onto the chest of one of the giants.
That giant was startled awake.
Pushed his companion and said:
'"Why did you hit me?" "Are you dreaming?" the companion replied, and the two continued to sleep.'
After a while,
the little tailor again toward the
Throwing stones at the two giants.
Repeating this over and over.
Both giants thought the other was disturbing their sweet dreams,
And were very angry.
They started fighting each other.
They fought until they were exhausted.
Both fell to the ground and died.
The little tailor killed the giant by borrowing the giant's "strength".
It not only saved himself from desperate situations,
but also eliminated two major scourges for the people.
These are typical examples of using the method of leveraging strength when one's own strength is insufficient.
3. Problem-solving method of creating advantages
Ancient Chinese military strategists highly valued "momentum" and had a very profound understanding of it.
Sun Tzu used many vivid metaphors for "momentum,"
He said,
A favorable "momentum" is like "the swiftness of rushing water,
that which can float stones," "like releasing accumulated water from a thousand-仞 (unit of measurement) ravine," "like rolling a round stone down a thousand-仞
of the mountain.
Of course,
what the ancients
The 'momentum' mentioned by the ancients is not formed naturally.
It is based on a certain military strength by the military commander,
Use your own wisdom,
Through maneuvers and other means,
Deploy the troops correctly,
To form a favorable arrangement in space and occupy a favorable position for your army,
Pose a threat to the enemy:
Or by capturing a key point or strategic location,
Annihilate a portion of the enemy,
Thereby disrupting the enemy's alignment and forcing them into a disadvantageous position.
In this way,
one can make one's own army incomparably brave,
and unstoppable:
causing the enemy to be shaken globally
To be routed at the mere sight of the enemy,
To be thrown into chaos without a fight,
Or even surrender without a fight.
Ancient Chinese military strategists therefore believed that,
A skilled strategist should be adept at studying 'momentum,' leveraging 'momentum,' planning 'momentum,' and creating 'momentum.'
For example, Sun Tzu advocated:
"Thus, a skilled commander
seeks effectiveness in momentum,
Do not blame others.
"The Hundred Chapters of Military Classics" also advocates:
"Those skilled in warfare focus on assessing the situation."
"Mao Zedong, who was very familiar with ancient Chinese military strategy, also placed great emphasis on the 'situation' and creating momentum."
He even attributed war activities to a contest between the commanders of the two armies to build momentum and compete for power.
He said:
"I want advantage and initiative,
and the enemy wants it too,
From this perspective,
War is the subjective ability of the commanders of two armies to compete for advantages and initiative based on material resources such as military strength and financial resources.
to compete for advantages and initiative.
Chapter 6, Aspects 6: Clarify your ability reserves for solving such problems = 167
'competition.'
'"Through this competition,'
'Create conditions and situations that are favorable to me and unfavorable to the enemy to oppress the other party.'
'This is Mao Zedong’s incisive interpretation of "shi" (势 - strategic advantage) and creating "shi" (造势 - momentum).'
Building momentum in combat,
is the war commander's assessment of the military strength of both sides and the political,
economic,
geographical and other conditions in the war zone,
Through their own efforts,
actively seek and occupy spatial positions that can enhance their combat effectiveness,
and proactively create a battlefield environment favorable to oneself and unfavorable to the enemy,
pattern, and situation.
Creating momentum aims to increase one's strength,
and to strive for and maintain initiative and freedom of action on the battlefield.
That is to say,
strategists use the principle of "momentum,"
Achieve the path of "winning by leveraging momentum".
In the year 383 AD,
Fu Jian, the King of the Former Qin, led an army of one million to attack the Eastern Jin Dynasty.
At that time,
The Eastern Jin Dynasty could only mobilize a little over a hundred thousand troops even with a full-scale effort.
The situation was extremely critical.
The imperial court and the public were shaken by it.
People were filled with anxiety and fear.
'However, Xie An, who was in charge of the imperial court, went on a leisurely trip,'
'meeting with relatives and friends as usual,'
'and calmly planning strategies to counter the enemy.'
'Xie An appointed his nephew Xie Xuan to take on the important task,'
He was ordered to lead troops to resist the invasion of the Former Qin army.
Fu Jian's army was very powerful,
And went straight to Jianye (now Nanjing).
Fu Jian himself claimed that,
His cavalry threw their whips into the river,
which could block the river.
Xie Xuan was a famous general who was good at fighting and
was brave and resourceful.
After calm analysis
Analysis,
He finally came up with a brilliant plan to defeat the powerful enemy.
At that time,
Qin,
The Qin and Jin armies faced each other across the Fei River.
Xie Xuan sent someone to tell Fu Jian,
If you, General, have the courage to retreat a bowshot's distance,
Our army will cross the river and fight a decisive battle with you.
Fu Jian was overjoyed to hear this,
Thinking to myself,
Once you're crossing the river,
I'll strike you when you're halfway across.
Xie An, ah, Xie An,
"How could you use such materials!" So,
Fu Jian happily gave the order,
To retreat 10 li.
Who knew,
The offensive formation suddenly changed
to a retreat,
The Qin soldiers were suspicious,
and their formation was thrown into chaos.
Xie Xuan seized the opportunity to order the army to bravely cross the river,
and set fire to it with the wind.
Zhu Xu, in the Qin army camp, incited some surrendered soldiers who were originally from Jin,
shouting:
"The Qin soldiers are defeated!"
"Run for your lives!" The Qin officers and soldiers believed it was true,
and were filled with terror,
scrambling to escape.
The Jin army pursued and fiercely attacked,
completely annihilating Fu Jian's million-strong army.
4. Methods for analyzing problems to control the situation
.In the process of analyzing problems,
If you want things to develop in your favor,
you must learn to control the situation.
The laws of things are objective,
but laws can be understood and utilized:
Laws are unchangeable,
but people can change the temporal and spatial conditions under which laws operate.
The general trend of history does not shift according to human will,
but the occurrence and development of historical events can be understood
Used and changed.
Therefore,
In analyzing problems,
The development and changes of the situation can be controlled.
Having controlled the situation,
many problems will be easily solved.
In the battle history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army,
Liu Bocheng,
Deng Xiaoping commanded the huge,
gold,
Fish Campaign, a brilliant excerpt of effectively managing the situation.
At the end of November 1946,
The Kuomintang's pseudo "National Assembly" has just convened.
To "add splendor" to this democratic farce under bayonets, Chiang Kai-shek was determined to show the "Communist bandits" a thing or two militarily.
To this end,
he extended two fists simultaneously towards the southern front,
A fist struck towards Su Bei.
With Xue Yue, Director of the Xuzhou "Pacification Headquarters," commanding 12 reorganized divisions,
They attacked the East China Liberated Area.
Another fist extended towards northern Henan and southern Hebei
Gu Zhutong, director of the Zhengzhou "Pacification Headquarters," commanded four reorganized divisions
to attack the Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated area.
Chiang Kai-shek's prized student, Chen Cheng, unified and coordinated the actions of the two war zones.
Chapter 6: Capabilities for Addressing Such Problems 169
Gu Zhutong divided his four reorganized divisions into two groups.
They were directed towards northern Henan and southern Hebei respectively.
The northern Henan group was the main force.
Their target was to seize the important towns on the Pinghan Railway.
The communist party's important base in the Jinji-Luyu liberated area, Handan.
Liu Bocheng,
The Jinlu Yu Field Army, led by Deng Xiaoping, in order to crush the enemy's offensive,
To reverse the passive situation,
Determined to target the enemy attacking northern Henan as the target of attack.
However,
because the Chiang army led by Wang Jingjiu always maintained a dense formation,
and advanced steadily,
Adding to that, it had been raining for days,
The ground was muddy and difficult to walk on,
Therefore, Liu,
Deng's main force maneuvered with the enemy for more than 20 days,
But I couldn't find a good opportunity to strike.
There were several times when the battlefield was chosen,
but it didn't work out.
Mid-December,
Jiang Jun occupied Puyang,
Linzhang,
Daming and several other regions,
and is now only half a day's journey away from Handan.
At this crucial moment of testing the commander's ability to deal with crises,
Liu Bocheng and
Deng Xiaoping demonstrated superb skills.
They made decisive decisions,
Abandon the enemy in northern Henan,
and use the main force to directly penetrate the enemy's hinterland in southwestern Shandong,
creating a threatening posture towards Xuzhou.
Thus,
A well-thought-out plan to launch a diversionary attack was quickly put into action.
At that time,
Chiang's main force in Zhengzhou lunged toward northern Henan,
and southern Hebei.
Xuzhou's main force advanced towards North China,
Consequently, southwestern Shandong became
a vulnerable and undefended area.
Liu,
Deng thrust a sharp knife into this place.
Chiang's army will inevitably come to the rescue.
This is similar to
It's similar to the historical strategy of 'besieging Wei to rescue Zhao'.
Later,
Because the enemy in Xuzhou frequently reported emergencies,
Chiang Kai-shek had no choice but to frustratingly withdraw his punches aimed at northern Henan.
and southern Hebei.
Therefore,
the crisis in Handan was thus resolved.
Liu,
Deng's army marched swiftly to southwestern Shandong,
capturing Liaocheng,
Juye and
After Jiayang,
The next goal is to prepare to capture Chengwu.
However, during the advance, the troops discovered that Jinxiang, a major town in southwestern Shandong, was defended by only one regiment of the enemy's 21st Brigade.
Therefore,
Liu,
Deng decisively,
changed the attack target again,
determined to capture Jinxiang first,
In order to mobilize Jiang Jun to come to aid.
The cunning enemy discovered the planning of...
Deng's predicament,
So they rushed to add a regiment's strength to Jinxiang two hours earlier,
To dramatically change the situation,
The fortifications of Jinxiang were quite solid,
The city had high walls and thick ramparts,
Surrounded by a moat on the outside,
Easy to defend, hard to attack.
Therefore,
When Liu
Deng's army's 3rd Column launched an attack,
After two days of intense fighting,
Yet there was no breakthrough.
Liu Bocheng and
Deng Xiaoping decided to increase their forces.
Another fierce attack,
but suffered the same setbacks,
The chief of staff of the 7th Brigade of the 3rd Column was killed.
Days of losses,
It cast a gloomy shadow over the hearts of the officers and soldiers.
Moreover,
due to the repeated calls for help from the defending enemy in Jinxiang,
Chiang's troops in the southwestern Shandong area had rushed in from all directions,
A new crisis is approaching.
Liu Bocheng,
Deng Xiaoping calmly analyzed the situation,
and made a wonderful decision—
—
Moths attack Jinxiang,
Divide and annihilate the enemy reinforcements.
Liu,
Deng believes that,
At this time, Jinxiang is already a rare and tempting bait.
Attacking the dragon too early
will scare away the big fish instead.
Therefore,
They decided to shift their attack target for the third time.
They would use only a portion of their forces to create a strong appearance of certainly capturing Jinxiang,
while using the main force to first annihilate one route of the enemy coming to reinforce.
And then seek to annihilate the enemy on other routes.
After careful planning and deployment, Liu,
The Deng army took only one day and night,
and annihilated more than 9,000 enemy troops of the Southern Route near Yutai.
Next,
Then, the enemies from the west were successively defeated.
The enemy reinforcements from the northwest and north were annihilated during their advance.
Chiang Kai-shek's painstakingly planned offensive thus collapsed.
16,400 officers and soldiers were either killed or wounded.
The nine county towns and vast rural areas in southwestern Shandong became liberated areas.
V.
How to use improvisation skills
Improvisation is a widely applicable problem-solving skill.
Whether it's national affairs,
family matters,
military affairs,
or foreign affairs,
They can always adopt appropriate countermeasures to deal with various problems.
Its characteristic is unconventionality.
Using all available means.
Adopting different flexible strategies for different problems.
The problem is ever-changing,
People's actions should also learn to adapt to circumstances.
Chapter 6: Clarifying the Six Dimensions to Build Capacity for Solving Such Problems 171
1. The Adaptive Method of Analyzing Problems
In the sixth year of Kangzhao (166 AD), Xuan Ye was fourteen years old.
According to the rules of mourning,
He could rule in his own right.
But Zheng Bai not only did not restrain himself in the slightest,
'Even more intensified.'
'Sukesa has always despised Zheng Bai,'
'Unwilling to associate with him,'
'But seeing his power and influence,'
Unable to fight against it,
It was the sixth day after the Emperor began to rule personally,
He submitted a memorial requesting retirement,
In order to "preserve his life."
Sukesahe's purpose in submitting the memorial was,
First, to show that Oboi was autocratic,
and that he had no choice but to retire;
Second, he tried to force Oboi to do so by his own retirement.
Yu Bilong also resigned accordingly,
handing over power to the government.
Zheng Bai naturally understood Sukesa's intention,
He and
Together with the party,
fabricated twenty-four major crimes against Sukesaha, such as "unwilling to return power,"
arrested and imprisoned him,
wanting to sentence him to death.
After the decision,
report to the emperor,
Kangxi
"insisted on not granting the request."
Bowing and vying, 'they pushed forward with raised arms,'
Forcibly requesting to 'play a melody to detain the sun.' In the end,
they only changed the extreme punishment to tattooing,
and executed Sukesaha.
After framing and wrongfully killing Sukesaha,
and acting tyrannically,
it has reached an intolerable level. Zheng Bai's existence
has become imperial
A serious threat to the Emperor's authority,
但
Zheng Bai's power has grown,
Holding great
power,
Improper handling
is likely to trigger huge changes.
After secretly discussing with his grandmother, the young Emperor Kangxi
used his intelligence and wisdom.
Preparing to eliminate the entire Oboi clique without leaving a trace.
Xuan Ye first adopted a "feigning retreat" strategy to paralyze the powerful minister Oboi.
He conferred the titles of "First Class Duke"
and "Second Class Duke" on Zheng Sheng and his son respectively.
Later, they were also granted the titles of "Grand Preceptor" and
"Junior Preceptor,"
making them ministers of the highest rank.
In September of the seventh year of Kangxi (1668),
Grand Secretariat Reader Xiong Cizhan submitted a memorial, saying:
"The court"
172- Nine aspects of dealing with super-analytical problems
The long-standing bad habits in government have not been eliminated.
He expressed concerns about potential national issues," and quoted the saying "The governance or chaos of the world depends on the emperor and his ministers.
He pointed out that the key lies in the person of Oboi.
Xuan Ye understood that this was the common wish of both Manchu and Han officials,
But he believed that the time was not yet ripe.
Then he feigned to reprimand them for "acting rashly and making false accusations to gain a false reputation," and claimed that he would punish them,
"to gain a false reputation," and claimed that he would punish them,
in order to paralyze Oboi.
By the eighth year of Kangxi (1669), the conflict between Xuan Ye and Oboi was intensifying.
Aobai, relying on his high position and power,
often used excuses not to attend court,
deciding all government matters in private beforehand,
and then implementing them
No matter how big or small the matter,
it must be reported to him first,
and no independent reporting to the emperor is allowed.
Once,
Aobai claimed to be ill and stayed at home.
Xuanye then went to visit him.
Heto, the imperial guard, noticed that Aobai's expression was abnormal.
He quickly walked to Aobai's bed.
Unveiling the mat, a dagger was discovered.
Zheng Bai was panic-stricken,
But Xuan Ye said nonchalantly:
"Keeping a knife on one's person is an old custom of the Manchus,
"No need to be surprised!" He immediately calmed Ao Bai down.
But Kangxi also further realized Ao Bai's sinister and malicious intentions,
and thus accelerated the process of eliminating him.
At the same time,
Xuan Ye also quietly made arrangements in the organization.
At that time,
The imperial palace guards were entirely undertaken by the Upper Three Banners,
But within the Upper Three Banners,
Aobai's power has gained an absolute advantage.
No longer dependable.
Therefore,
Xuan Ye specially selected a group of loyal and reliable young men to enter the palace
Under the name of \"Lianshi Kuxi\" (Manchu:
Wrestling),
another more reliable guard was formed—
—
the Shanpu Battalion.
These youths were all from noble families,
and they practiced wrestling with the young emperor every day,
which didn't attract
attention.
Until Xuan Ye believed that the time was ripe to eliminate Oboi.
Before the action,
Kangxi sent Oboi's partisans out of Beijing one after another under various pretexts,
in order to weaken his power.
On May 16th, the eighth year of the Kangxi reign (1669),
Xuan Ye personally mobilized and deployed the Shanpu Battalion.
He asked the men face to face:
"You are all my trusted and long-serving officials.
Then are you afraid of me,
"or are you afraid of Aobai?" The young men replied aloud:
"We are only afraid of the Emperor!" So,
Kangxi announced Aobai's crimes,
Summon Ao Bai in.
Chapter 6: Clarifying Your Ability Reserves for Solving Such Problems 173
Palace,
"Order to capture him immediately."
Xuanye, without moving a single knife or spear,
Eliminated the powerful traitorous officials,
And shocked the imperial court.
Later generations admired the young Emperor Kangxi's wisdom and decisiveness,
Heartfelt appreciation.
Kangxi's brilliance lay in:
First, adapting to the trend,
Conferring titles on Zheng Jing's father and son
小
"First Class Merit,"
"Second Class"
Merit,
"Grand Tutor,"
Titles such as "Junior Tutor";
二
is a perverse act against the proper procedure of official appointment
turning a blind eye,
pretending to be confused
To smear,
Deliberately misinterpret;
Thirdly, it is
Quietly organize one's own power
Strength:
practicing "Buku Opera"
in the name of
Additionally, organize a more reliable army—
—
Shanpuying (Wrestling Unit).
The beauty of organizing this army lies in:
① Young aristocratic children,
Not attracting attention in terms of age,
It has strong concealment.
Wrestling training,
It is a normal activity in the Manchu ethnic group,
It is not eye-catching in form.
③ Seize and capture Zheng Bai in the name of wrestling.
Victory allows advancement,
Defeat allows retreat,
Respond flexibly.
Therefore,
Xuanye eliminated the powerful and treacherous officials without using a single sword or spear.
Eliminated the powerful and treacherous officials.
2. Analyzing Problems: The Method of Adapting to the Situation
Since Xiang Yu's major defeat of the Han army at Pengcheng,
Personally led a large army to drive straight in,
Attacking Jingyi and Jingting south of Xingyang.
King of Han, Liu Bang, seeing the great strength of the Chu army,
First, he held firm and did not come out,
Later, he sent elite troops to raid the Chu camp,
and each side had its own victories and defeats.
As a result,
the two armies were east of Rongyang,
Forming a confrontational situation.
King Han adopted a strategy of avoiding the substantial and attacking the insubstantial,
with Liu Bang personally guarding Xingyang,
using a small number of troops to hold Xiang in check.
Adopted Han Xin's suggestion,
Sent Han Xin to lead the main force of the Han army north,
to attack Zhao and
Dai,
讨
174 Grasping the nine aspects of analyzing problems
To attack the Yan State,
And pacify the Qi territory to the east,
To the south, cut off the Chu army's supply route,
And then formed a
Encircling map for the Chu army.
Han Xin's army first defeated the Dai army at Yangyu (northwest of Heshun, Shanxi Province today).
After capturing the chancellor Xia Shuo and Zhao Wang Ge, Chen Yu received the news,
Immediately concentrate 200,000 heavily armed troops at Jingxing Pass (present-day Jingxing, Hebei),
and await in a strict formation.
After Han Xin conquered the Dai kingdom,
Liu Bang transferred his elite troops back to Rongyang.
Resisting Xiang Yu,
This greatly reduced Han Xin's forces,
Leaving him with only a few thousand men.
And Jingxing Pass is one of the important passes of the Taihang Mountains;
It is a strategic location for military strategists.
It is also a necessary route for east-west transportation.
At that time, the situation was unfavorable to Han Xin.
Zhao's strategists,
Guangwu Jun consulted Zuo Che, who believed that,
Han Xin and
Zhang Er took advantage of the victory to attack,
and their momentum was irresistible
However, the Jingxing Pass road is difficult to navigate.
Vehicles cannot travel side by side.
And the ranks cannot be formed.
Han Xin had to pass through these hundreds of miles of narrow mountain roads.
The baggage train will inevitably lag far behind.
Therefore,
He suggested to Chen Yu:
"If you give me 30,000 elite troops,
Cut off the Han army's supplies from the trails.
You should dig deep trenches and build high walls.
Do not engage the Han army in battle.
This way, the Han army will want to fight but be unable to.
There's no way to retreat,
In less than ten days,
The Han army will undoubtedly be defeated.
Execute Han Xin,
Zhang Er's head will be ours today.
If we miss this opportunity,
we will be defeated by them instead.
"
Chen Yu was originally a bookworm,
Originally, I didn't understand the art of war.
He didn't think much of Li Zuoche's advice,
saying:
"My army is one of benevolence and righteousness,
Do not value deceptive strategies.
Han Xin's command,
Claimed to number tens of thousands,
But in reality, it was only a few thousand.
Moreover, having come from afar,
You must be very tired.
To defeat such a small number of enemies,
If you dare not resist,
The feudal lords will definitely laugh at me for being cowardly,
and will attack me at any time.
”
A scout reported to Han Xin,
who was secretly delighted.
Then he boldly set up camp 30 li away from the Jingxing Pass.
It was midnight.
Han Xin began to muster his troops.
First, he carefully selected two thousand light cavalrymen.
Each carrying Han army banners,
They advanced via a small path,
Hiding in the Laoshan mountain near the Zhao army's camp.
Han Xin instructed these soldiers, saying:
"If the Zhao army sees our army retreating,"
They will surely come out in full force,
And pursue and kill our army.
At this time,
You immediately rush into the Zhao army's camp,
Pull down the Zhao army's flags,
And replace them with the Han army's banners.
"Then order the lieutenant general to distribute rations to everyone,"
Let them fill their stomachs first.
And he said confidently:
"After we crush the Zhao army,"
We will have a feast for everyone—
"Pause." The generals were skeptical.
Han Xin then sent another elite troop as the advance guard,
exiting the Jingxing Pass,
with their backs to the Mianshou River,
Facing the Zhao army's position,
They arrayed their formation.
The Zhao army seized the advantageous terrain of Jingxing Pass,
intending to engage in a decisive battle with the main force of the Han army;
Now I see the Han army forming a battle formation with their backs to the river,
Chen Yu couldn't help but burst out laughing:
"Forming a battle formation with their backs to the river,"
Only allows advance,
No retreat is allowed.
This is a major taboo in military strategy.
Defeat the Han army,
Behead Han Xin.
"It shall be today!” Order the troops to prepare for attack.
The sky was just beginning to brighten,
Han Xin personally led the troops,
Raising the banner high,
Beat the war drums,
Charge out of the Jingxing Pass. Chen Yu widely opens the camp gates,
And sends out troops to battle.
The two sides clash,
Relying on their numerical superiority, the Zhao army
拥
Chapter 6: Clarifying the Capability Reserve of Qingyin in Solving Such Problems: 175 Coins
stepped forward
to surround Han Xin.
Han Xin urgently ordered the commander's flag to be abandoned,
Throw away the war drums,
And retreat backward.
Chen Yu deployed his troops to pursue and kill with all his might,
Even the Zhao soldiers guarding the main camp wanted to take advantage of the situation to claim credit.
They even brought out Zhao King Xie.
Plundering the Han army's flags and drums,
Overjoyed and self-satisfied.
The sound of cheering was like thunder.
Han Xin retreated to the Wei River,
and issued the order:
"Fight to the death!
"Retreat and be cut down!" The Han soldiers saw the river in front of them,
and pursuing troops behind them,
with no way to retreat.
So they fought desperately to survive.
Turning back, they fought fiercely.
The two armies fought from the flat plain until noon,
still without a clear victor. Chen Yu, fearing his troops were hungry
and unable to fight any longer,
Then he ordered the return to camp.
Unexpectedly, halfway there,
he saw that the camp was full of Han Chinese banners.
He cried out in alarm:
"“How could our main camp be captured by the Han army!” The Zhao army was immediately thrown into panic."
Their formation was instantly thrown into disarray,
and they scrambled to escape.
Chen Yu couldn't stop them at all,
Although some fleeing soldiers were killed,
it was impossible to reverse the defeat.
The Han army attacked from both sides,
fighting more and more bravely.
Captured Zhao Wang Ge alive.
Chen Yu was also killed by mutinous soldiers.
In the Battle of Jingxing Pass,
the Han army won a great victory.
The generals congratulated General Han Xin one after another.
They asked Han Xin:
"Military books clearly state, 'The right side should be backed by mountains and the front should face water.'"
The right side should be backed by mountains and the front should face water.
When marching and deploying troops,
the rear should be close to hills and mountains,
and the front should be close to water.
Deployed troops according to the principle of 'backed by mountains and facing water'.
Deployed troops according to the principle of 'backed by mountains and facing water'.
But the general did not act according to military strategy,
but instead made us form a battle formation with our backs to the river.
And confidently said, 'We will destroy Zhao and have a feast.' As a result, they really won.
What is the principle behind this? Please explain it clearly, General.
”
Han Xin replied with a smile:
"Isn't this also a military strategy? There is a saying in military strategy like this:
Plunge into the depths of death and then live,
Place in the land of annihilation and then survive.
Our team is not well-trained,
If placed in a comfortable position,
They are bound to scatter and collapse at the first sign of setbacks.
Only by placing them in a desperate situation,
and forcing them to fight for themselves,
can they summon a hundredfold courage.
No one can stop him.
"All the generals listened,
They were all filled with admiration.
They unanimously praised Han Xin for being good at using surprise tactics to win.
The tactics he adopted were beyond the expectations of ordinary people.
176- Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
'"Han Xin defeated the enemy by deploying his troops with their backs to the river" was based on the situation of both the enemy and ourselves.'
He adopted the tactic of "putting oneself in a death ground and then living."
To transform an unfavorable situation into a favorable one,
achieving victory in battle.
In this battle,
Han Xin's side had three disadvantages:
First, the troop strength is unfavorable.
The number of personnel is less than the opponent.
Second, the terrain is unfavorable.
The opponent took the lead in occupying favorable terrain.
Third, the quality of the soldiers was poor.
"The troops were not well-trained."
There are four reasons why Han Xin won this battle:
First, the opposing commander did not understand the art of war.
Second, Han Xin sent elite troops to hide near the enemy camp, waiting for an opportunity to create a situation of attacking from both the front and rear.
三
Han Xin deployed troops with their backs to the water, turning three disadvantages
into three advantages.
Because of death
Deploy the troops.
There is no turning back.
There are only two paths in front of the soldiers:
Either kill the enemy,
Or be killed by the enemy.
So the terrain became an inspiring battle drum,
Turning disadvantage into advantage.
The terrain makes soldiers,
Each fights on their own,
Courage increased a hundredfold,
Compensating for the weaknesses of insufficient personnel and inadequate quality.
Fourth, Han Xin said confidently:
"After decisively defeating the Zhao army,"
再
"Please everyone, enjoy a hearty meal." The commander's confidence boosted the soldiers' courage through morale,
and strengthened the soldiers' belief in certain victory.
In a word,
Han Xin's victory was due to his ability to adapt to the times,
adapt to the place,
and adapt to the people,
flexibly applying strategies and tactics.
VI.
Do you have a sense of intuition?
Too many people are cautious when dealing with problems,
And collect the relevant information excellently
Chapter 6, Aspect 6: Understand your ability reserves for solving such problems. 177
Report,
But when it comes to making actual decisions,
It lets 'the duck that's already in your hand fly away'.
Because they didn't know there were other options available,
the analysis they conducted did not provide them with a good chance to achieve their goals.
When you need to make a unique analysis from only a few available options,
you may need to list the pros and cons of each available option.
Carefully consider the relative importance of each "pro" and "con" opinion,
Make decisions based on weighted positive opinions.
1. Advantages of Intuitive Analysis
Intuitive analysis has at least one advantage.
Undoubtedly,
it takes far less time than the systematic analysis we will present in the following pages.
Everyone has to rely on intuition to decide many small issues.
In addition,
In theory,
An intuitive analysis also involves knowledge that you possess but cannot explain in words or language.
And in principle,
your brain can perform an analysis more quickly than any formalized analysis you might come up with.
178 Currency: Grasping nine aspects of problem analysis
Fatigue and weariness,
Distraction and the influence of trivial matters in life, etc.
So,
The downsides of intuitive analysis are far greater than most people realize.
The consistency achieved by those who use intuition to analyze (doctors prescribing,
supervisors hiring subordinates,
salespeople evaluating the future, etc.) is far lower than they are usually thought to have.
3. Some Simple Good Choices Beyond Intuition
Aside from intuition,
people use some other simple ways to make choices.
The two most important ways are:
(1) Simple excerpting and grading.
(2) Common sense reasoning in special professions.
Just like pure intuition,
Both of these methods have their place.
They are especially useful when you need to do a quick analysis from a large number of choices.
They are especially useful.
But using these two methods does not guarantee that the analysis you do will be excellent.
Suppose you want to eat in a newly arrived, unfamiliar city,
A simple rule is:
First, eliminate the most expensive or the cheapest restaurants.
Then eliminate restaurants that cannot supply fresh fish.
Next, eliminate those that are more than 20 minutes away by car
Wait.
You will quickly narrow your choices down to just one or two.
Unfortunately,
This approach is too crude.
For example,
you might miss driving
to a restaurant that's 25 minutes away but has great service,
or a restaurant that's only slightly over your budget.
Although that's the case,
many financial institutions use this set of procedures.
Chapter 6: Clarifying the Ability of "Yin" to Solve Such Problems i 179
to review personal loan applicants.
They use certain preset standards to select each applicant.
Only after meeting all the minimum requirements,
will they accept this borrower.
For example,
A bank may stipulate that only applicants who meet all of the following conditions
are eligible for a loan:
(1) Have a good record of previous loans and repayments.
(2) At least 25% of their income is discretionary.
He has lived at the current address for at least one year.
Served in the current position for at least one year.
Belongs to technical workers or white-collar workers.
This selection rule is the "entry rule".
Introductory rules can be very useful,
especially when weeding out a large number of unsuitable
selection objects.
But it can also easily let the organization
Gou neglected its serious deficiency.
For example,
Please consider the following two loan applicants:
Please note that Ms. Smith has met all the requirements,
But it's just barely passing.
In comparison,
Ms. Jones, apart from the job classification,
meets and far exceeds all other criteria,
However, the loan was rejected by the bank.
This example serves to illustrate the inherent rigidity of simplistic selections and rating rules:
A surplus in one area cannot compensate for or offset deficiencies in other areas.
Resulting in excellent
Qualified candidates are turned away,
while mediocre ones get through.
If applied to personnel recruitment analysis or admissions,
the entry rules can have further adverse effects.
Introductory rules and other category selection systems eliminate the random inconsistencies brought about by purely intuitive methods.
However, because they cannot utilize all available information and situations with 'unique complementarity' (where there are many excellent evaluations in certain traits but they cannot compensate for a certain deficiency), selection rules can only be applied to rough classification or evaluation level work.

Confronting Troublemakers
Practice time:

Number of uses:
Occasionally
Sometimes,
You may run into some troublemakers,
They are not the kind of people who go around smashing things (of course, this behavior is not encouraged), but rather people who constantly influence your analysis of problems.
They are usually cynical.
They suspect your motives are impure.
They vent their grievances at every opportunity.
There were once several excellent analysts,
They turned a blind eye to the troublemakers,
and saw them as challenges trying to restore their due rights.
Chapter 6, Aspect 6: Clarify your capabilities for solving this type of problem. p. 181
者，
Be careful with them,
Never touch on the sensitive areas of the troublemakers.
Unfortunately,
In the process of regaining their rights (which is rarely successful, of course), troublemakers are constantly affecting your work passion.
The ideal approach is:
To talk to the troublemakers sincerely,
Explain your principles and positions,
And try to win their understanding and support.
Training 2:
Keep promises
Practice time:

Always says "Leave this to me,"
Which is understood as "I can't do anything."
How pathetic.
Your promises are worthless now.
If you don't keep your promises,
I can assure you:
It will definitely have a negative impact.
Whether people stop trusting you forever because of one instance of dishonesty,
or gradually distrust you because you often break your promises,
it's all a negative impact.
The prerequisite to solving this problem is to remember what you are.
what time you made the commitment.
Sometimes,
A casual remark may lead people to understand it as a commitment—
-if this is the case,
Then let it be your commitment! You might just mean \"I'll think about it,\" but
if most people interpret this to mean:
"I guarantee I will take care of it," then you'd better take care of it.
Once you realize you've made a commitment,
I need to write it down quickly.
Therefore,
we are required to keep a diary,
and write down what promises you have made.

Then they will feel that you are true to your word.
Chapter 7
Aspect Seven:
Be good at writing an outline of your analysis of the problem
184 Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
7
A mental framework that can simplify and organize problem analysis
We call it an outline.
An outline can maintain the level of complexity controlled by our memory space.
Lacking a framework,
no one can make a rational analysis.
First,
It is best to have one framework for each question.
Everyone must simplify things.
Even when you embark on the most ordinary analysis—
—
For example, shopping for a new TV—
—
You can never consider all possibly relevant information completely (in the next 10 years,
What features do you want it to have? Did you get it at the lowest price? Will it make your eyes tired?)
From the greatest geniuses to ordinary clerks,
everyone must adopt
Chapter Seven, Aspect Seven:
Good at writing your analytical outline of Wen Jun h -185
Multiple mental outlines.
Rice simplifies and organizes the information encountered in life.
For example,
If you want to buy a TV very wisely,
then you might start by listing a few key features you want.
Then go to a few stores to take a look,
Talk to friends and ask for advice,
Or browse through consumer reports and magazines,
and select one.
No matter how you analyze it,
you will inevitably overlook certain things in your analysis.
1. Understand the business points of the outline
Blind spots in the outline are very common.
No outline—
—
As you know,
There is no way of thinking—
—
that can take into account all possible situations.
Therefore,
no one can completely avoid the dangers inherent in an outline.
Many professionals are not even aware that this phenomenon exists.
Therefore, they pay a heavy price.
Take window frames as an example.
This dilemma can be cleverly illustrated.
Architects must choose where to install windows,
in order to obtain the desired view.
But no window can see the whole panorama.
When you choose a window to look out—
—
Or even if you decide to watch all three windows at the same time,
Tracking to see what happens—
—
You still can't be sure beforehand,
What you see is the most practical and useful picture.
The outline of an analysis inevitably sets a scope:
It controls what is inside,
and what is outside.
Furthermore,
Not all internal factors should be given equal importance.
The purpose of setting up an outline is to focus on certain matters,
While downplaying other parts.
For example,
If an advertising agency simply asks:
"How can we reduce costs?" or "How can other advertising agencies reduce costs?" These types of questions lead its practitioners to some simple cost-cutting techniques,
such as delaying the purchase of office equipment,
or firing some employees with low productivity.
Now, let's assume it's the same advertising agency,
If you add a little more inquiry material to its outline.
"How are other categories of people reducing costs,
without compromising their quality?" This opens a window to more creative possibilities for change.
2. Strength of the outline
The outline has great power.
The outline will greatly affect people's final problem-solving
186 h Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
Choice.
A framework for how people or institutions routinely handle problems,
that will control how they react when faced with the vast majority of problems.
But the pitfalls of frameworks can indeed turn a group of managers with outstanding potential into terrible ones.
Big donkey egg.
For example,
A large consumer products company promoted its talented marketing vice president to the position of executive director.
But he is still stuck in the "marketing outline." He always focuses on the old view of understanding customers and meeting their needs.
As
As the chief executive,
Ordered the company to launch dozens of new products,
New styles and new colors:
He made
every retail store stock
An extremely large inventory,
to prevent stockouts.
In fact,
The company cannot withstand this kind of single-item suppression force.
After a few months,
the factory manager was unable to carry out the orders of this top executive,
because the costs and delivery times were difficult to control and he couldn't cope.
Moreover, inventory increased,
backlog funds
Leading to a surge in interest expenses.
For several years of losses
After damage,
The board had to ask him to leave.
We read from time to time in this book,
Some companies lose money like it's a normal occurrence for years,
because they isolate themselves in something that feels good,
Basically, it is not suitable in the outline.
This outline does not conform to the actual situation of the company,
Nor does it conform to the laws of market operation,
Although they also simplify reality in the same way.
So if the outline is set improperly,
it will have serious consequences,
and may even cost you dearly.
The best outline highlights important key points,
Unimportant parts fade into darkness.
But a winning framework will be more open and receptive to expected future information.
Therefore, a good framework is both art and science,
and the two are closely intertwined.
Chapter Seven, Aspect Seven:
Be good at writing an outline of your analysis of the problem —
3. One outline for one problem
When faced with a new problem,
Good analysts (like most other people) will design and create an analytical framework specifically to solve this problem.
They will specially design and create an analytical framework to solve this problem.
Few people have a thorough understanding of the analytical framework they employ.
If you can have a thorough understanding of your own analytical framework,
You may be able to make better analyses:
When these analyses must change,
you will be more clearly aware of the changes that are necessary.
The most important thing for a senior executive is
The task is to create,
select, and manage the process that enables the company to choose a winning outline.
The so-called winning process—
that is, the correct way to consider problems,
It can focus attention on the most important aspects of the problem,
and also give appropriate attention to other aspects.
A winning framework can lead to wise choices.
In order to understand your own framework,
First, you need to think about:
(1) The scope you define for the problem.
(2) The reference point you use to define success or failure.
(3) The standards you use for evaluation and comparison.
Then,
In order to have a clearer understanding of the situation,
you need to think about the metaphors or deeper frameworks in your deep mind, whether conscious or subconscious (for example,
some car buyers have a frantic bargaining with dealers in their minds,
Strive to kill to the lowest price:
While some buyers place a little more consideration on establishing long-term relationships with dealers).
The concepts contained in the analysis come from your culture,
occupation,
Educational level and family background,
想

Thinking about these ideas.
Usually before you make the final decision,
Will go through other outlines to
Scrutinize your analysis.
This looks like a complicated and big job,
when you do it for the first time,
It's really a big job.
In the long run,
Trained analytical methods are less effort than untrained ones.
4. Analysis by Professor Daniel of the University of California and Professor Tversky of Stanford University
Experiment
Scope is one of the simplest components in a problem outline.
But you may not even understand the scope defined by the outline in a small analysis.
The following exercise is from Professor Daniel Kahneman of the University of California, Berkeley.
Developed with Professor Amos Tversky of Stanford University,
to explain how scope affects analysis,
Please try this exercise.
First, please immerse yourself in the following scenario:
(1) Scenario A:
You have decided to go to a play,
and spent 30 yuan on a ticket.
When you get to the theater,
Discovered the ticket was lost.
There is no seat number on the ticket.
Lost tickets cannot be recovered.
Are you willing to spend another 30 yuan to buy another ticket to see the show (assuming you have enough money with you)?
We haven't told you anything about this play (except that for some reason you were originally willing to pay $30 to see it), but please try to decide whether you would be willing to spend another $30 to buy another ticket anyway.
After you make a decision,
please consider the second scenario.
(2) Scenario B:
You've decided to go see a play,
The admission tickets are 30 yuan each,
but you haven't bought a ticket yet. When you arrive at the entrance of the theater,
Discovered that 30 yuan was lost from Pi Yang's money. Are you still willing to use 30 yuan to buy a ticket to see a play (assuming you have enough money left)?
How would you like to choose? Are you willing to spend 30 yuan to buy a ticket?
They posed scenario A (lost ticket) and scenario B (lost money) to more than 100 people.
Each person saw only one version.
The result is:
Chapter 7, Aspect 7:
Be good at writing out your analysis of the key points of the problem —
h
189
When people are told a ticket is lost,
38% of people say they are unwilling to pay another 30 yuan to buy another ticket to see the show.
When they were told the money was lost,
Only 17% of people said they were unwilling to pay 30 yuan to buy a ticket.
But there shouldn't be a difference! After all,
You have the same loss in both scenarios.
The same loss of money.
Then why aren't you equally willing—
Or unwilling—
To buy a ticket? When losing a ticket replaces losing money,
People analyze the outline with different attitudes,
Therefore, people's attitudes also vary accordingly.
Many people who are told their ticket is lost feel that
Buying another ticket is like spending 60 yuan to watch the show.
In contrast,
In scenario B, the loss of money
is associated much less in people's minds with the act of going to the theater.
Their intuition scopes around the question, "Should I spend money to buy a ticket?"
Losing a ticket is within the realm of possibility,
while losing money is outside the realm of life.
The scope of people's daily work can strongly frame their views of the entire company or the entire business.
Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
There are many kinds of problem scenarios.
People in most fields tend to narrow the scope of their thinking about problems,
and their solutions to any problem are likely to come from within the scope they define.
This example is reminiscent of the fable of the six blind men and the elephant:
Everyone only touched a part of it.
What exactly is the real problem? The task force concluded that,
The general manager of the subsidiary hindered coordination and cooperation between departments.
He often criticized every department,
and encouraged departments to attack each other.
Senior managers must overcome the limitations of narrow agendas in different departments,
to make them all feel part of a whole.
The company's general manager erred on this point,
The result made it impossible for work to proceed normally,
and the parent company asked him to leave.
The new general manager refused to wade into petty disputes between departments,
and soon the company reported another profit victory.
On the other hand,
Sometimes the problem lies in errors in defining the proper scope.
For example,
A careful analysis of a major American steel company revealed that,
If it replaces the existing hot iron mixing technology that requires heating twice with a direct injection technique that heats only once,
it should be able to save tens to millions of dollars in costs each year.
But this proposal, after a long delay,
Chapter Seven, Aspect Seven:
Good at writing your analysis of Wen Shuang's outline 191
before being approved,
because its senior engineers complained that
this analysis "did not include the cost of the hot iron mixer" —
This machine was purchased for $3 million a few years ago.
A properly defined scope must exclude past investment costs from consideration.
The company has already spent the money.
The debt listed on the balance sheet remains fixed regardless of whether you use the new direct injection technology.
A rational analysis must be based on a comparison of future revenues and sunk costs (including the residual value of the hot iron mixer,
rather than the original purchase price).
But people are often reluctant to make themselves feel they have made a mistake,
so they gloss over things and lump everything together,
Leading to even greater oversights.
5. Standards and Analysis
The standards people use in analyzing outlines can also cause confusion.
Consider the following exercise.
It is adapted from the work of Richard Thaler of Cornell University.
●Situation A:
You are in a store,
planning to buy a new watch that costs 70 yuan.
When you are waiting for the salesperson,
a friend comes and tells you that,
another store two blocks away sells the same watch for only 40 yuan.
You know that store's service and reputation are just as good as this one.
Are you willing to walk two blocks to save 30 yuan?
Please analyze yes or no.
Then think about the next similar scenario.
●Scenario B:
You are in a store,
planning to buy a new Zhencai machine that costs 800 yuan.
While you are waiting for the salesperson,
a friend comes to tell you that,
Another store two blocks away has the same camera for only 770 yuan.
You know that store's service and credit are just as good as this one.
Would you be willing to walk two blocks to save 30 yuan?
A famous American consulting firm once raised a similar question in front of hundreds of people.
In scenario A,
About 90% of people say they are willing to walk two more blocks.
In scenario B,
Only 50% of people are willing.
But there is no real difference between the two scenarios.
The essential question in both cases is "Are you willing to walk two blocks to save 30 yuan?"
People,
Especially those
192 Grasping the Nine Aspects of Analyzing Problems
Insightful and excellent analysts,
should see through the appearance of problems,
and analyze and adopt the same processing method in two different contexts.
The reason people make different decisions
is because they are used to thinking in terms of percentage savings,
rather than absolute amounts.
But as far as the purchase of watches and cameras is concerned,
Percentage standards are of no real significance.
You already know that both stores have the same creditworthiness.
So all that needs to be considered is whether your pocket is thicker or thinner,
referring to the amount of money—
—
Not a percentage.
When the person dealing with the problem evaluates their own performance,
standard controls are especially important.
A Japan Airlines pilot on a 1968 flight from Tokyo to San Francisco
On the journey,
taking this juggling act to a ridiculous extreme.
As the DC-8 he was piloting passed through low-lying clouds,
and due to poor communication with the control tower during landing,
Three kilometers away from the runway,
causing a "perfect" water landing—
—
ditching in the bay of San Francisco.
Fortunately
No casualties.
While discussing with the media,
he described the course of the problem,
using the trick of expressing the missed outline as a percentage:
"Think about me flying all the way from Tokyo,"
"How much error did I make?" His boss didn't buy it at all,
demoting him to co-pilot,
limited to Asian routes.
6. Allusion and Analysis
In many people's problem outlines,
Allusions play a significant role.
Good analysts can carefully select allusions to highlight important aspects that can be exploited in the context.
A clumsy analyst (or just an analyst who barely passes in a narrow range)
Chapter Seven Aspect Seven:
Be good at writing an outline of your analysis of the problem 193
may also automatically use one or two metaphors to summarize everything.
For example,
They might frame everything as a football game,
a war, or a family.
Any time we use metaphors wisely,
We replace the current situation or unique phenomenon we are considering (which we do not yet fully understand) with another phrase that we understand more clearly.
Transformative metaphors can be particularly helpful in our understanding of problems,
sometimes transforming into something we've developed from growth,
parts of a framework formed by education, or professional experience.
7. Thinking Outline
Many thinking outlines are deeply rooted within small groups or organizations,
so that when environmental changes necessitate alterations,
people still stick to the old ways.
When a framework for thinking is adopted by an entire culture,
Called "the culture's framework," it is often the best example of this reluctance to change.
The following is an example recorded by the historian Herodotus more than 2400 years ago.
Darius was king,
He summoned those Greeks who were with him,
and asked how much money it would take for them to consent to cook and eat their dead fathers.
The Greeks replied that there was nothing in the world that could induce them to do such a thing.
Then Darius summoned those Callatian Indians who eat their deceased parents,
They rioted when asked how much it would cost to cremate their deceased father (like the Greeks did);
and told him that something like that was out of the question.
194 n Grasping the nine aspects of problem analysis
Although many organizational frameworks are not as dramatic in comparison,
But we should not underestimate the impact of thinking frameworks on people.
For example,
Organizational leaders often infuse metaphors into the thinking frameworks of the entire organizational culture.
The Johnson family owns S.C. Johnson & Son (formerly known as Johnson Wax),
and views its company as one big family.
The company's top executive, Shan Zhongsen, once flew all 1,500 employees of the 70-year-old British subsidiary to the United States for a week.
Because he cares about the employees in the UK,
and worries that they might feel slighted because they are too far away from the United States.
When you find yourself stuck in a framework of thinking that doesn't fit the environment,
If you try to change it,
you might be wasting your time.
Do the best analysis you can,
and use the relevance of its thinking outline.
Get people to accept your point of view.
8. Error Outline
We need a thinking outline directory,
to understand all things.
Any thinking framework has its inherent dangers,
The more frequently it is used,
the more likely it is to inadvertently
reveal itself under certain circumstances.
When your mental structure is coherent,
it will be repeatedly used on different countermeasures,
and control your ability to understand,
then you may use it to form an outline of analytical errors.
Outlines are dangerous,
because they play tricks on our minds.
Often they seem more complete than they actually are (and therefore seem more applicable than they actually are).
All outlines have undergone a simplification process,
Therefore, it inherently contains certain gaps,
which will make you unable to see the missing part.
This is one of the reasons why we ourselves are easily locked within a single framework.
Seen from within the framework,
It seems complete and practical.
Understanding the three key risks in forming an outline
is very beneficial for preventing faulty outlines:
(1) If you don't understand the outline,
We will have a framework for looking at each time.
Chapter 7, Aspect 7:
Be good at writing an outline of your analysis of the problem 195
Please try our new flavor!
(2) Once locked within a certain framework,
it becomes difficult to break free and change.
(3) Most problems should be examined through more than one framework.
To really achieve that,
However, it has its difficulties.
There is no single
framework that can fully grasp the complex and ever-changing issues.
In many cases,
It could even be said that no single framework can adequately grasp a complex problem.
Usually you have to use multiple frameworks,
and you should carefully select one or more of them to apply.
If you want to examine a problem through more than one framework,
Normally, we have to test them one by one.
II.
Your Topic Outline
Athletes can break records every year,
At least one of the important reasons is included:
Their coaches are aware of the situation,
Outstanding athletic performance relies on coaches conducting systematic analysis of the athletic process.
It can be said that every sport,
From years of accumulated experience,
Top coaches can learn from outstanding athletic achievements
more about the process and better ways to impart it.
Being a good problem analyst is like being a great athlete.
You must systematically review the analysis process:
You must understand how each part of the process contributes to excellent analysis,
and understand the errors associated with each part.
And you must continuously
196 Grasping the Nine Aspects of Problem Analysis
Put effort into eliminating the mistakes you still make at all levels.
For example, someone who is well-trained can be wary of overconfidence in their own judgment.
He can avoid the habit of shirking responsibility by finding reasons in past analyses.
If he likes to compare his business to a football game,
then he should check regularly
to see if the analogy still fits the real problems in his business.
The correct way to play golf often goes against your intuition (e.g.,
Most beginners think they should bend their arms when they swing.
Similarly,
The correct analysis can often disrupt your natural preferences.
Good analysts understand that,
What they "know" is often wrong,
Even if they are recognized as experts in a certain field,
this is no exception.
Just like the senior management training director of Royal Dutch Shell,
Spoken by Ron van Beaumont:
"Our executives must learn
when not to trust their judgment.
"
1. The process of excellent analysis
The process of excellent analysis can be divided into four main factors.
Every good analyst, whether consciously or subconsciously, must go through each of these factors.
They are:
(1) Outline.
It forms the skeleton of the problem.
It signifies defining what must be analyzed,
and initially establishes the trade-off criteria,
causing you to prefer one choice and abandon others.
In the outline,
good analysts consider their views on the issue in relation to others,
and determine what is important and
what is not important in the problem.
Therefore, they will inevitably simplify everything.
For example,
When deciding who to promote,
leaders may simply ask
Aspect Seven of Chapter Seven:
Good at writing an outline of your analysis of the problem 197
The topic is defined as:
"Choose the person who can generate the best performance in the workgroup."
"It should be noted that,"
This view will force other relevant parts of the problem to be hidden,
such as the ability to coordinate with other departments in the organization,
relationships with external customers,
or whether the award should go to the most hardworking and practical employee
Or perhaps a senior veteran cadre member, etc.
(2) Gather intelligence.
Identify the known facts you need to make decisions,
and reasonable estimates of the "unknowns."
Good analysts control the collection of intelligence with a cautious attitude,
to avoid falling prey to overconfidence in what they currently believe,
and failures caused by a tendency towards bias.
As Will Rogers said:
"It's not the unknown that causes trouble."
It's when what we know isn't so that we get into trouble.
"
(3) Draw conclusions.
A perfect outline and good intelligence gathering do not guarantee wise analysis.
Judgments made by people based solely on past experience,
intuition,
or speculation will not always lead to good analysis,
even with perfect information in front of them.
A systematic approach can force you to examine many levels.
Usually, it can achieve some better analysis.
It's much better than rambling aimlessly for hours.
For example,
A considerable amount of research has shown that.
Whether novice or expert,
when they act according to systematic rules,
they will arrive at more accurate judgments than if they relied solely on their intuitive judgment.
(4) Learn from feedback (or fail to learn).
In order to learn from the results of past analyses,
Everyone must establish a system.
It usually refers to the continuous tracking of the expected results,
Systematically preventing self-serving interpretations from occurring.
And it will definitely be able to review the lessons learned from the feedback,
and thus apply them to similar analyses in the future.
These four development dimensions constitute the backbone of almost any analytical process.
But they are not like the breakdown of a golf swing and other related movements,
The developmental aspects of the analysis process are not a series of consecutive actions.
As you can imagine,
the information discovered during the 'intelligence gathering' phase often allows you to backtrack,
and reframe your analysis.
Furthermore,
A complex problem (such as the relocation of your business premises) may require a series of smaller analyses,
each of which will involve several analytical outlines,
multiple intelligence gathering efforts,
and several steps to draw conclusions.
Nine Aspects of City Analysis
But you must separate each of those developmental aspects of your analysis and consider them individually.
Unless you clearly know which part you are analyzing at a given moment,
you will not be able to figure out which part has a specific error.
Once you understand its various stages and pitfalls,
it's usually much easier to prevent mistakes.
A beautiful golf swing or swimming stroke doesn't take any more effort than a clumsy movement.
The same principle can be applied to a good analysis process.
2. Metaphysical Analysis
The four main parts of the analysis process consume almost all of a good analyst's analysis time.
But in the beginning,
You should make a decision about the analysis process itself—
—
These choices can have a decisive impact on the overall effort.
A wise and timely metaphysical analysis can help you avoid analysis trap number one:
Jumping in headfirst.
When you tackle any major problem,
You should spend a few minutes (occasionally a few hours) thinking about the more difficult parts of the problem you are facing.
Metaphysical analysis includes a question-and-answer component.
Like, "What is the crux of this issue? Broadly speaking,
How can I believe that this analysis should be adopted? As a preliminary estimate,
How much time should I spend at each level of development?
The vast majority of analysts are too focused on metaphysical analysis.
They usually fall into analysis trap number one:
Rushing into the analysis process.
For example,
The negotiator is too lazy to ask,
How to respond appropriately to the opponent's proposal.
A company with accumulated losses may not ask itself what the crux of saving the company is.
A company discussing a new product may not want to delve too deeply,
How can the analysis of new products be well controlled?
After completing the metaphysical analysis,
you will have a sense of which aspects are most important,
Make appropriate judgments regarding how much time and resources should be spent on each section, and how much to allocate.
Make appropriate judgments.
Three,
Establishing an outline without making mistakes
Most people don't choose a framework,
but stumble upon it haphazardly with vague understanding.
They might define and frame their problems with a cautious attitude.
But because they don't understand the techniques of a framework,
Therefore, they have no control over this process.
Chapter Seven Aspect Seven:
Writing an outline for the analysis of drinking problems = 199
1. Understand your own framework
The key to making a proper analysis lies in:
Understanding your own outline.
You must understand how you are simplifying your problems.
The first step in achieving outline awareness is:
It's about understanding how you define the scope around the problem.
Michael Porter, a strategy expert at Harvard Business School, outlined how companies can improve competition,
This kind of outline often causes companies to pay less attention to competitive pressures on profits from other sources,
Such as their own suppliers (who may be charging them too much),
Customers (who often want to pay less
and enjoy more services),
alternative products,
potential entrants,
Government,
employees, etc.
Porter strives to require every company to figure out who its real "competitive" opponents are.
For example,
The petroleum industry should regard the government as its primary "competitor,"
because for every dollar of petroleum product sold, forty cents goes into the government's pocket in the form of taxes.
Therefore,
in order to make more informed analyses,
We must understand our own framework,
and be ready to revise the outline again when necessary.
2. Understand the outlines of others
In addition,
The key to communicating with others is:
Understand their framework.
If you can clearly understand how others are framing their problems,
Then you can communicate very well with others.
A dramatic instance of conflict occurred during World War II,
when civil servants in U.S. government agencies questioned the loyalty of Japanese Americans,
asking in a commanding tone:
"\"Who do you want to win this war,"
America or Japan?
Many Japanese Americans intuitively feel that
this question is not appropriate for the context they are in.
They love both countries.
So they tried to shift the argument from a military issue to a family issue.
replied:
"When you see your father and mother fighting,"
"who do you want to win? You just want them to stop fighting." Their framing was different from the questioner's.
This is something the questioner did not expect.
He doesn't understand the framework of issues for this particular group.
Instead, he put himself in a dilemma.
3. Impartial Acceptance Framework
When you deal with new problems,
Try to keep your framework unbiased and open to all opinions.
200 - Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
in a receptive state.
In the early 1970s,
long before "Japanese-style management" became a sensation,
management guru Peter Drucker had already pointed out that
Japanese companies seemed particularly good at big analysis.
He wrote,
"“For the Japanese,
An important factor in analysis lies in defining the problem.
"“The crucial step is to decide whether there is a need for analysis,
Analysis of what.
In this stage,
The Japanese aim to take
Obtain a consistent opinion.
”
In other words,
on major issues,
analyze how to frame
the process of,
Japanese companies will work hard to reach a consensus.
This will take a long time,
But it guarantees that
The company can fully accept all kinds of related information.
American companies, on the other hand, tend to expect "their project and long-term planning teams to make recommendations—
—
which limits them to one option."
Unfortunately,
under immature frameworks and decisions,
No matter how well they analyze each option,
however, in
practical application, it is destined to be
full of errors.
Sometimes, this unbiased and accepting attitude can bring great flexibility to your problem-solving process.
In 1959, Honda Motor began to break into the American market.
Chairman Soichiro Honda told his marketing team that
the focus should be on Honda's larger motorcycles,
Because they were similar to the models widely sold in the American market at the time.
So Honda salesmen rode around Los Angeles on economical and cheap Honda Super Cubs, trying to drum up business.
To people
Chapter Seven, Aspect Seven:
Yoshiko, write down your analysis of the problem carefully - h 201
We are introducing and promoting larger Honda motorcycles.
But Californians began asking where they could buy the super little guy.
Honda heard this response from customers.
In just a few short years,
a general outline will be re-established for the major direction of entering the US market,
focusing all efforts on lightweight motorcycles for general customers.
Honda's open attitude towards its customers has led to the production of a brand new product,
This caused motorcycle registrations in the United States to increase tenfold from 1960 to 1971.
4. Understand when to reframe
For most analyses,
you already have a certain framework in place.
No one constantly re-frames every activity in their life.
But the most important skill in the analysis process.
Perhaps it lies in knowing when a problem must be re-outlined.
If you continue to use an inappropriate outline—
—
That is, your continued use of that simplistic approach that blinds you, deafens you, and makes you lose sight of the key points of the problem—
—
will eventually lead your analysis into a dead end.
During the 1960s and 70s,
the aviation industry itself formed a regulated structure.
They make a prescribed profit,
and then allocate it to flight attendants,
flight attendants, and suppliers.
But when the US government ordered the industry to deregulate,
A fierce price war has erupted.
Therefore, the outline must be revised.
To adapt to this new highly competitive business environment,
American Airlines,
Northwest and Delta Airlines executives adapted and revised the outline,
and as a result, business is booming.
And those who were unwilling or unable to modify (like Global,
Pan Am, and Pan Guan Airlines) almost went bankrupt and closed down.
However, the necessity of re-architecture is often not very obvious.
For example,
a real estate development partnership established a hiring policy to employ people with outstanding achievements in sports,
because it believes that athletes possess the sprint and determination, as well as the tenacious spirit.
It is indispensable for the pursuit of real estate development to step into a successful path.
Soon the market environment began to change.
The needs of the market have turned to old factories,
Renovating warehouses and apartment buildings,
Replaced the high-rise buildings in the original business district and the construction of large suburban commercial areas.
Managers and supervisors are confused,
why the previously vigorous employees now seem less energetic and are often frustrated.
One of the partners,
He used to
202 h= Nine aspects of analyzing problems
was also an athlete,
Understood the truth of the matter:
The company's old methods of employing people are no longer suitable for the needs of the new business.
Although confident athletes can urge government agencies' civil servants and contractors to act quickly,
they are overwhelmed when dealing with the relocation of the original tenants and the variety of situations in the old buildings,
and are less flexible.
Therefore, he left the company to seek other opportunities.
Meanwhile, his old colleagues are still struggling in a very depressed environment.
5. Understand your current outline
A draft of the problem outline analysis can help you understand your current outline.
Usually, you wouldn't deliberately think about matters related to your architecture.
Therefore, you might not find the questions on the draft easy to answer.
You don't have to answer every question one by one.
Skip it if you can't figure it out.
Possibly a better way,
You might as well wait for the feeling of inflammation to come before answering.
When starting to define the scope of the outline,
Please try the following prompts:
Start by thinking about the possible choices that you would automatically dismiss.
But that colleagues or competitors would not.
You're absolutely right to dismiss them,
but the scope you define will be different from that of your colleagues or competitors (you may also want to ask yourself:
What is the probability that your viewpoint contains choices that others have eliminated?
The slogan to answer for the last question is similar to Ronald El Singer's insight:
"Classic warfare principles are key to successful major marketing operations."
8. Challenge your outline
A crucial step in reframing a problem is to understand that your framework isn't the only valid one.
Someone else's framework might be better than yours…
Consider.
Seek advice from others.
Don't let others nitpick your outline for you.
Looking at your own outline is sometimes like looking at your own nose—others can see it more clearly than you can.
Enlist a detractor to evaluate your approach to the problem,
and critique the validity of your reasoning (unfortunately,
The best antagonists are often the ones we truly dislike.
And our favorite subjects are those who share our views.
Impersonate your opponent.
If an analysis involves competitors,
It is necessary to simulate their viewpoints,
or assign some members of the project team to form a group to play the role of the opponent.
This is a technique that has proven effective over time.
Chapter Seven, Aspect Seven:
Skilled at writing analytical outlines of drinking problems 203
Dissent is welcome.
Find ways to bring people with different thinking styles into the group.
From multiple perspectives
Consider issues from different perspectives.
Brainstorming.
Encourage team members to make suggestions,
to change your approach to the current problem.
And have a member be responsible for writing down all the suggestions.
No criticism of each other is allowed.
other party.
Then, after all the brainstorming is finished,
Evaluate the suggestions.
Think laterally.
Try to look at the problem from the side,
Look at it from a different angle.
For example,
If someone complains that the elevator in the building is too slow,
in addition to
considering speeding it up (i.e., addressing the problem based on the issue raised),
You can try to change their perception of "waiting for a long time."
Add a makeup mirror next to the elevator,
Or a bulletin board,
Or audio equipment.
Get ready, etc.
It might be much cheaper than installing a more powerful elevator.
Research on the creative process.
Try thinking analogically.
When engineers first attempted to build airplanes,
or various strong and tall structures,
they drew from biological analogies,
such as taking inspiration from flying birds (or gliding) and bees building strong honeycombs.
The essence of creative process research is to bring together seemingly unrelated factors—
—
Such as honeycombs and architectural design.
Identify the correlations between things,
And then try to analogize.
The result may be a powerful creative idea.
You can try it yourself:
Can a Swiss Army knife guide you on how to organize your problems? Think about its replaceable components,
complementary tools,
Versatile components,
Small and exquisite structure,
在
Nine aspects of analyzing problems
The connection between form and function, etc.
Consider alternative metaphors.
In order to make your career successful,
Should you act more like a general,
A religious leader,
A mountaineer,
Or a swimmer striving for a sprint? If you're joining a new company,
Do you want the company's environment to be more like a family,
or like a well-oiled machine?
Or like a military camp? In order to make a name for yourself in the industry you want to enter,
Do you want the company you work for to behave like a football team?
Or a symphony orchestra,
Or a scene in a Japanese garden (using the garden metaphor,
Intended to invoke the Japanese emphasis on long-term concepts - a bonsai tree that remains evergreen for ten thousand years?
Negotiation.
Traditionally, negotiations are framed with metaphors of war or sports,
That is, phrases like "win-lose."
This view of success or failure has been replaced by the "win-win" framework.
Several books on this subject, such as "Getting to Yes" by Roger Fisher and William Ury, have transformed the negotiation framework to be more like a journey than a battle.
They argue that both sides can achieve, or nearly achieve, their respective goals.
Some issues, like salary negotiations, may indeed be quite success-or-failure oriented.
However, the success or failure of salary negotiation is only seen in terms of short-term financial situation.
If it involves other aspects like professional growth,
benefits,
responsibilities,
Promotions, etc.,
are beyond the scope of success or failure.
IV.
What is the meaning of the kitchen turntable metaphor?
This wonderful kitchen turntable metaphor is meant to illustrate the power of establishing a framework when analyzing problems,
which is almost identical to the idea of solving problems with moderation.
The metaphor is as follows:
The owner of a restaurant found that the chef and the waitress were always arguing about the customers' orders.
Especially during peak dining hours.
So the owner consulted four experts for advice.
The following four different approaches emerged.
A sociologist divides this issue by identity and class level:
The chef was unhappy about taking the order from a waitress of lower status.
He suggested heart-to-heart communication training for both the chef and the waitress.
Chapter Seven Aspect Seven:
Be good at writing your analysis of the problem. 205
An anthropologist, on the other hand, emphasizes cultural norms.
Specifically, the role played by gender differences.
Male chefs don't like their actions being dominated by women.
He suggested empowering a senior head chef to manage the entire system—
—
He directs the waitress to place the menus at the designated spot.
Then, he compiles all the menus and distributes them to other chefs.
A psychologist analyzes the issue through the lens of sibling rivalry:
The chef and waitress are like siblings vying for the boss's favor.
And the boss is like a parent to them.
He suggested holding weekly consultation meetings,
to let the two groups improve their communication skills.
An information theorist attributes it to "cognitive overload."
At peak times,
There are too many order tickets to keep in mind,
Resulting in tension and friction around the kitchen.
He suggested the waitresses enter the orders into a new computer system,
It can display the appropriate menu for each chef at the appropriate time.
The boss was completely confused,
He felt uneasy,
And didn't know which solution to use.
If he chose one of them,
and it didn't work,
what was he to do? In desperation,
he mentioned the problem to a young chef.
The other party replied:
"You know,
At the restaurant where I used to work,
They had a rotating plate in the kitchen,
We'll just clip the menu on top.
The cooks just have to turn it.
Do you think this method will work here?
The boss said,
He couldn't figure out if it would work.
So he took the idea to four experts.
Each one continued to recommend the original course of action,
But they all also said that if you use a turntable,
It may alleviate the severity of this problem.
Sociologists say that
The turntable will smooth out the identity issue (because until the chef reaches for the menu,
they just have to lie there obediently).
Anthropologists say that the lazy Susan will depersonalize the initiative of action.
This allows cooks to be freed from the demeaning status of being seen as male or female roles.
Psychologists say that the lazy Susan will reduce friction between cooks and waitresses.
Minimizing the degree of rivalry, like that between children vying for parental affection.
Information theorists say that,
If we use a computer as a comparison,
The turntable is like adding an external memory to the entire ordering system (i.e., the menu can be directly used, saving the computer's paper).
The owner installed a turntable in the kitchen,
After using it, I can attest that this method is very effective.
From then on,
He would never consider any advice from experts again.
Nine aspects of quick analysis of problems
Of course,
The basic tenet derived from this is that
If an analysis makes sense through several different frameworks,
it is a good analysis.

Number of uses:
Regular
If your work involves business trips to places outside the company,
especially business trips abroad,
Or attend some meetings,
Then, this training will specifically discuss this aspect.
Sometimes,
This kind of business trip is considered "fun": more for pleasure than for the company's benefit.
It's more like seeking happiness for oneself.
In fact,
Both aspects are generally present.
Business trips do have some commercial value,
Or even if they don't have commercial value,
they can still be a lot of fun.
Your boss is considering giving you a business trip opportunity,
You can analyze the purpose of this business trip and the way it is carried out to see if you can turn the excitement of these travels into the driving force of your work.
You should think very carefully about this business trip opportunity.
Can someone else go on the business trip?
Although business trips cost the company some money,
But anyway,
Money is meant to be spent.
For an individual,
being able to create effective business value for the company,
and also broaden one's own horizons,
Looking for some happiness,
That's also very good.
As far as the company is concerned,
Business trips are work that can generate positive management effects without additional expenses.
It wouldn't be a bad thing.

Or have you ever gone deep into the masses to collect opinions extensively?
Have you considered and handled problems from multiple perspectives?

Aspect 8:
Carefully verify your answers
210=h Grasp nine aspects of problem analysis
The Art of War says:
"Know yourself and know your enemy,"
and you will never be defeated.
'"Knowing yourself and knowing your enemy" is the strategy of seeking evidence in tactics.'
Also,
In a rapidly changing society, diverse and multifaceted opinions are the strategies you seek to verify during your analysis.
This information, gathered to "know the enemy" in order to deal with problems,
we collectively call intelligence.
So,
Information is essential data for you to verify your questions.
First,
Know yourself and you will know your enemy.
In 1921,
Newton D. Baker was the U.S. Secretary of War.
Brigadier General Billy Mitchell said that airplanes dropping bombs on battleships would sink them,
but Secretary of War Newton D. Baker did not believe that airplanes would be so powerful.
Hence, these words were spoken:
Chapter 8, Aspect 8:
The heart seeks to verify your answer 211
"This is a goddamn boring and impractical idea,"
Therefore, when that ass wanted to attack from the air,
I'd rather be on the bridge of a warship taking the hits.
"
Newton Baker was one of the most distinguished of the U.S. Secretaries of War.
When he took office in 1916,
He was a staunch anti-war activist (President Wilson held him in high esteem,
because he had a strong record of rectifying and reforming the city during his tenure as the Minister of Justice and Mayor of Cleveland).
But at that time, Wilson's Republican Party held only a minority of seats in Congress,
so Congress openly rejected the "reform" measures he carried out.
But after the United States entered World War I,
Baker's spirit of resistance and dedication—
—
and the efficiency of his department—
—
Even,
Earn the respect of his Republican opponents.
Such a shrewd and capable person,
How could he conclude that,
In America's best interests
In a bombing attack strategy, is the pilot safe?
Is he safe standing on the bridge of the battleship?
The most obvious answer is,
Beck and his combat unit made a wrong judgment.
Even the best analysts make this kind of mistake.
In the era of World War I
Middle,
Many educated people were convinced that an attack by planes, like a mosquito bite, could never sink a battleship.
Becker's mistake illustrates that
intelligent people can also make mistakes when they fail to carefully evaluate the information they
possess.
It also illustrates a common analytical trap for most people.
Judge based on what is known
For example,
If you are choosing a legal advisory firm,
When collecting and listing the criteria of your framework,
You will naturally ask the law firms you are considering the questions you want to know.
If you haven't listed the information you need while the framework is in progress,
After having a framework that you think is good,
immediately list the information you need.
Please list the detailed list.
Never mind how difficult it may be to obtain information,
Boldly list information that seems impossible to obtain (such as the inflation rate for the next 5 years from now).
The intelligence gathering part of the analysis process is not just hardware information,
And it should include everything that can be covered under 'Situation'.
212 Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing questions
Including all factors that can be covered under the 'Report'—
—
Just like making reasonable estimates or guesses on key issues where precise information cannot be found.
It's really difficult to make truly good estimates about things we only know partially.
Nevertheless,
Doing so is often still an essential step in doing excellent analysis.
Systematically collecting and using information,
will reduce overconfidence,
Existing biases,
and the dangers posed by the trap of clinging to benchmarks.
In order to prevent these errors from occurring,
we must also gain a deeper understanding of how and why they affect otherwise intelligent and insightful people.
Sometimes, special methods or techniques are also necessary to cooperate.
2. Overconfidence
Are you overconfident in what you believe? Many studies have shown that
virtually everyone gives too much confidence to their own opinions.
Like people "knowing" that certain steps must be taken to solve their problems, and so on.
There are many people who are overconfident in what they believe.
Once injured,
their confidence brings unquestionable negative views on their own value and ability.
Insecure people are even more certain that they are more inadequate than any real situation suggests!
3. Conformity bias
Another related problem with overconfidence is:
People love facts and evidence that support their current beliefs.
Rather than factual evidence that would challenge their beliefs.
The vast majority of people seem to have a natural preference for information that supports their current beliefs.
And reject factual evidence that contradicts their beliefs.
This situation can lead to organizational structures going astray and acting recklessly.
Because a focused search effort can usually turn up hundreds of pieces of factual evidence,
all of which can support certain assumptions.
Confirmation bias occurs when dealing with problems,
because confirmatory factual evidence can bring us mental comfort.
It seems that every piece indicates:
"You are on a smooth path…
…
You are doing well."
"On the other hand,"
Factual evidence that does not conform indicates:
"Your idea is not as good as you think it is.
" In short,
Confirming factual evidence makes people feel good,
Non-conformity can be regrettable (at least in the short term), as honest advice is hard to swallow.
Therefore, people tend to turn a blind eye to factual evidence that may undermine their ideas.
Chapter Eight, Aspect Eight:
Carefully verify your answers - h 213
To avoid conformity bias,
you need to be well-trained to seek out dissenting information that may contradict your opinions.
If you make an effort to find it,
and find nothing,
Then you will have reason to be full of confidence.
One of the ways to find it is
to set up an alternative hypothesis,
and test them together.
4. Understand what you don't know
Part
Clearly framing your analysis,
is a partial antidote to prevent you from being overconfident in your judgment.
Carefully defining the problem often helps you understand where the difficulty lies.
Carefully list the information needed for analysis,
It is a weapon to further resist overconfidence.
After doing so,
Allows us to recognize our inherent bias towards confirmatory factual evidence.
Ultimately, avoiding overconfidence requires developing secondary knowledge—
essential knowledge—
—
a good understanding of both what you know and what you don't know.
General Mickey uses his primary knowledge to predict that planes can sink battleships.
He knows that planes can drop bombs,
and battleships cannot dodge.
Newton Baker is also using his primary knowledge.
He understood the strength of steel,
and the difficulty of a fast-moving aircraft bombing a moving target.
But Newton lacked secondary knowledge—
—
namely, the question of how credible the prediction of the destructive power of aircraft-carried bombs was.
The primary knowledge determines the direction of our opinions:
Secondary knowledge is the factor that influences our confidence.
You must develop your secondary knowledge.
And you need to use good secondary knowledge for reasoning and judgment.

5. Don't listen to know-it-alls
Please consider these two gentlemen:
Know-it-all and Good-tempered.
Both individuals possess professional knowledge (for example,
like tax law).
You have to rely on the professional knowledge provided by one of them.
The generalist is more knowledgeable,
He surpasses Mr. Good Humor in key areas of knowledge.
In any test of right and wrong within a professional field,
he is more adept than Mr. Good Humor.
But unfortunately,
The know-it-all thinks he has more knowledge than he actually does.
Sometimes he states categorically that a certain tax avoidance measure of yours won't work,
but in reality, as long as you intend to do so,
this method is feasible.
In comparison,
The good-tempered man understands what he doesn't know.
When he is unsure about a problem,
When he is not sure,
Will delve into research or seek advice from experts.
In true/false tests,
Mr. Good Temperament knows that he is often just guessing.
So which one would you prefer to use as a tax advisor? In the vast majority of cases,
It is best to choose Mr. Good Temper.
To ensure the successful completion of intelligence gathering work,
We must clearly understand our limitations in knowledge.
If Mr. Know-It-All guarantees that he knows everything about the laws of depreciation,
But if there's a misstep at a critical angle,
Then your company's losses could be as high as several million U.S. dollars.
But Westerners might prefer the "Mr. Know-it-all."
The reason is that they associate confidence with competence.
Their culture encourages overconfidence.
6. Treat overconfidence as a strategic weapon
When analyzing problems,
The ideal analyst should be a realist,
但
Chapter 8, Aspect 8:
Carefully verify your answer -215
During execution,
He should be an optimist.
Unfortunately,
only a very few people:
Are able to master the role transition between realism and idealism just right.
In order to achieve the desired effect,
You must believe that certain things can be done, and at the same time, you yourself must stand from an outsider's perspective to analyze the problem calmly and seriously.
How can you maintain your own detached analytical ability to sprint forward with full confidence? For example, how do generals lead their troops to carry out missions.
They convey messages to the rank and file in the most optimistic way.
But they will find ways to avoid possible distortions of their grand strategy.
They will ask pointed questions.
They will seek to expose the bare reality.
…
After they have settled on a plan for the battle,
they marched straight ahead to assemble the troops at the camp.
Deep within:
There is a touching confidence.
It's just like leading troops into battle.
A certain degree of overconfident momentum can drive everyone forward,
However, from the overall perspective, a realistic and steady attitude should be maintained.
In an abstract sense,
This set seems simple and easy to implement.
But where does the role transition from a realist to an idealist actually occur? Many people hold both identities.
The key to the problem lies in sincerity.
Whether in terms of reality or ideals,
Overconfidence must be clearly understood and properly controlled.
Good secondary knowledge must be mixed with valuable (but not too dangerous!) "positive thinking" instincts.
Proper control of overconfidence,
Means that when you gather intelligence or do analysis, you must think about problems carefully and pragmatically.
Consider the choices you might have,
Specify their range or possibilities,
Weigh the possibilities—
—
Include both the pros and cons.
To know when you know,
and to know when you do not know, is knowledge.
This is knowledge.

they must inflate themselves beyond reality.

We agree with Goethe's point of view.
But when doing analysis,
We prefer Confucius' view.

7. Vivid and distinct experiences
Vivid and distinct experiences can also create biases.
and particularly difficult to overcome.
A single, vivid experience can easily transform people's perceptions,
because it is firmly etched in their minds,
and it readily comes to mind.
For example,
After watching a horror movie,
people will be afraid of shadows.
After news media reports a major plane crash disaster in detail,
People are afraid of flying.
After you first watched the movie "Jaws,"
Do you remember the unease you felt on the beach in the summer? Vivid experiences can even interfere with people's analysis.
II.
The Effect of Feedback
You, like everyone else,
will experience serious interference from various cognitive biases.
So how can you get truly good intelligence?
But these erroneous tendencies are so deeply ingrained in human thinking,
therefore you may need to have simpler methods to understand more knowledge,
to overcome these errors from arising.
1. Step 1:
Require each estimate to include a "level of confidence."
The first step in systematizing intelligence collection is to ask:
"What is the significance of this estimate?" Unless you know exactly what the estimate means,
it is difficult to improve it.
Assume you are a sales manager at a company and you announce that,
You 'have reason to be certain' that you can sell 200,000 Wald brand sprockets in the next year.
You understand what you mean,
It's not saying that he will sell exactly 200,000 sprockets, no more, no less.
Should the company's manufacturing department plan to produce exactly 200,000 units? Of course not.
However, what do your estimates tell others? In fact,
Do you yourself know exactly what you are expressing?
In order to properly create useful estimates,
You must fit them into a form in which their meaning is precisely understood—
—
—
A form that allows you to assess whether a predictor's record is good or bad.
The best way is to list a range or confidence level.
Chapter 8, Aspect Eight:
Carefully verify your answer h 217
Accurate:
"I estimate we will sell 180,000 to 200,000 Ward brand small rings in the second half of the year."
I am 80% confident.
"An estimate in this form will be far more effective than a numerically definitive prediction."
It allows you to plan for the future with the existing knowledge you currently have,
or when you are not certain enough,
to work hard to obtain better information.
Moreover, it makes it easier for forecasters to learn from experience.
If you don't specify a range and confidence level,
and only say that you "have reason to be sure" that you can sell 200,000 Ward brand small circles in the next year,
then you are betting your personal credibility on the prediction.
Suppose you've been saying for three consecutive years,
You have reason to be sure he'll sell 200,000 Circles.
But in reality, the first year he sold 175,000,
The second year he sold 140,000,
Sold 230,000 units in the third year.
If you only give a single numerical prediction,
others may endlessly argue about whether your error is reasonable.
But if you predict a
Scope,
180,000 ~ per year
200,000,
with 80% of self
Believe in the water level conditions.
Because a series of sales figures over the past 3 years are no longer within the scope of prediction.
So you should feel embarrassed and unable to step down.
Of course,
Incorrect predictions not only damage your credibility,
but also harm the overall operations of the company you are in.
To protect your own credibility,
you should learn to make more accurate confidence range estimates.
After a while,
You may find that when you say you are "80% sure" about something,
there is indeed an 80% chance of it happening.
Ideally, you can use a linear model approach to create estimates.
Now your estimated figures will enable the manufacturing department to deal with suppliers realistically.
218; Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
and the finance department can plan practical
cash flow.
However, without an estimated range of confidence,
Proper risk assessment is truly impossible.
Sometimes you don't have to state your prediction in terms of a range.
For example,
If you are recommending a particular contractor,
And you want to express your confidence,
That fellow will come to the company on a specific date,
Then you can simply say,
你
There is a 95% certainty that this manufacturer will come.
Moreover, their work performance is acceptable.
2. Step Two:
Provide feedback and training to make estimations more accurate.
Once you introduce range and confidence levels into your estimates,
you need to be sure that
you receive timely and accurate feedback when making estimates,
and that you are improving through training
You are responsible for pursuing excellent results.
Royal Dutch Shell saved millions of dollars by training in forecasting techniques.
...improving the accuracy of oil field drilling analysis.
After Shell required geologists applying to the company to list their confidence levels in their predictions,
Found that newly hired geologists made more mistakes at the listed confidence levels.
The young geologist said there was a 50% chance of finding an oil field,
while the success rate of oil field exploitation was as low as 30% each time. As a result, Shell spent billions of dollars on unnecessary drilling.
These young geologists all have authoritative diplomas and credentials.
But the basic knowledge they possessed far exceeded the secondary knowledge they had—
They overestimated what they knew.
Once they knew the ropes,
After learning how oil wells are actually found,
These young geologists are learning how to make their predictions "accurate."
Wait until the geologist has
Chapter Eight, Aspect Eight:
Double-check your answer = 219
With years of experience,
Shell can boldly trust them,
If they say that 12 well sites each have a 50% chance of success,
Then about half of those wells will be successful.
Therefore, Shell Oil Company started a new type of training course.
It presents inexperienced geologists with a summary of past examples.
This includes a wide range of factors that can predict oil fields.
For each site,
They all have to deal with a digitized level of confidence.
Then,
They'll get feedback—
—
They are told if oil has actually been found at each site.
This training is surprisingly effective.
Currently, even young and inexperienced Shell geologists,
when predicting a 50% chance of oil production at a site,
the company can still achieve nearly 5 successful outcomes out of every 10 predictions.
3. Step 3:
Asking questions that don't encourage conformity
"The 'conformity bias' can lead intelligent people away from reality."
Once you recalibrate your estimation process,
Propose the correct range and confidence level,
rather than making predictions with only a risky single number,
Next, what you should do is regularly ask yourself some
appropriate number of non-conforming questions.
'Not conforming to thinking tendencies is a good teacher and friend for analyzing and dealing with problems.'
All my toys are for you.
For example,
In a small metal products company,
An inventory auditor discovered a discrepancy between the actual quantity of raw materials in their factory and the quantity that should have been shown on the books.
The factory manager suspects that thieves are stealing these metal raw materials,
because the factory has been plagued by theft problems recently,
and the managers asked the security guards to be more vigilant.
They interrogated the suspicious employees,
and even spent a weekend looking for clues in the factory.
Everyone
220 Nine Aspects of Analyzing Problems
Wringing their brains out, they were stuck on how these metal raw materials were stolen.
Meanwhile, the inventory system showed that the amount of stolen raw materials was equivalent to the factory's annual surplus.
They were stunned.
They didn't know how to report this to the boss.
But they couldn't find any trace of the thief either.
By Monday,
They reported the problem to the general manager, frustrated.
The boss only asked
A question—
—
But it's a non-conforming question:
"Assuming it was stolen,
How much metal raw material needs to be stolen to be equal to the difference in numbers?"
This problem surprised the managers.
They hadn't calculated how much it was,
because it was irrelevant to the question of who might be the thief. After a few minutes of calculation,
they replied:
"It should be as tall as a small mountain."
"The inventory system reported an impossible amount of metal material to lose."
Managers kept pushing their “thief theory” and therefore never asked themselves a few basic questions that could examine their assumptions.
"How much metal material has “vanished”? Are there other reasons to explain the discrepancy that would be more reasonable than attributing it to theft? The boss"
Asking lightly eliminates the possibility of theft:
No one could secretly move so many metal raw materials.
After a few hours,
They found that due to changes in accounting staff,
The incorrect application of a procedure to update inventory records in real-time
resulted in a major accounting error.
We believe the general manager's incisive ability is not simply based on luck.
He understands the art of not conforming to problems—

Finding information issues
To show that our original judgment was wrong.

It is an important technique for effectively eliminating our deep-seated dilemma of being stuck in many dead ends.

Not conforming to the question,
Used to question the information you have.
Gather the focal points of every major question.
You should ask some non-conforming questions.
Not only covering your questions.
Also include your sources.
Often because the source of information consistently provides incorrect information,
it causes deviations in estimates or forecasts.
Three,
Accurate intelligence is the key to verifying your answers.
Previously,
we have introduced several intelligence gathering techniques,
which can be used to improve your chances of success.
A good analyst should:
●Insist on stating their estimates in terms of range and confidence level,
so that their meaning is clear:
●Create feedback for those who make estimates,
Training and explanation,
so that they can improve their skills;
● Ask questions that do not conform to the original assumptions (if they are wrong);
● Use terms such as error,
Creating simulated scenarios,
And doing some forward-looking techniques in advance,
Find out why the plan becomes more
complex than you originally thought;
● Avoid collecting too much data for estimation and analysis,
unless you have a way to synthesize them to make them coherent.
If you can have a clear understanding of all the biases we are naturally prone to,
and can take the above steps to eliminate them,
You may be able to create sufficient intelligence,
Analyze the nine aspects of the problem with a frown
And lay a good foundation for excellent analysis.
Let's take a look at the famous RAND case together—
—
A fault tree analysis of restaurant failure.
One simple way to make potential problems more apparent
is to draw a fault tree,
detailing the many places where a complex system can go wrong.
If you want to examine the various reasons why a restaurant might fail (and by doing so,
you can make a pragmatic assessment of the risks of investing in a new restaurant,
and minimize them), then you need to draw a failure tree,
with its major branches representing the main forms of failure.
Then, list the secondary groups under each main branch.
Each secondary group also contains an "all other" category of errors.
Error trees can help people understand the possible reasons for problems more clearly in their minds.
Therefore, it can be beneficial for people to pragmatically consider the possibilities of various dilemmas.
To maximize the effectiveness of a fault tree,
you must list the problem areas on the fault tree as comprehensively as possible.
Otherwise, the estimated figures will still suffer from availability bias.
On a major branch of the fault tree, under the item "Decreased number of guests,"
A group listed 6 reasons plus an "all other" category.
The reasons they listed included "incorrect pricing,"
"unclear features,"
"outdated restaurant concept," and so on.
This group specifically warned that,
Remember to include any possible reasons that are not specifically listed under 'All Other' items." But managers listed an average of only 7% of the reasons under "All Other.
The second group listed 12 reasons under the "Decreasing Number of Customers" item—
The original 6 plus 6 more, such as "poor food quality,"
'"Poor service quality," "changes in competition," and so on.'
A longer list of reasons was supplemented by 6 additional reasons.
And these managers assigned them a combined 50% probability.
The "all other" item was reduced to only 4%.
Thus, the total probability assigned by the first group to its 'all other' category should be 54%.
In other words,
The first group, simply because it didn't list reasons for customer decline such as poor food on the original table,
poor service, etc.,
has greatly underestimated the likelihood of these reasons.
If you break a big plan into small pieces,
and try to estimate the time required for each part,
then error trees are particularly useful,
Able to produce effective time estimates

words.
Usually, you'll find that you can make accurate numerical estimates for certain parts of what you plan.
That's because you've had similar work experience completing those parts.
As for these parts,
you don't need to draw a fault tree for them.
But after estimating certain parts based on your past experience,
then you can draw a fault tree to estimate the parts of the plan that you know less about.

Analysis of famous cases—

Why Did Coca-Cola Take the Risk?
April 23, 1985,
Coca-Cola Company Chairman Roberto Goizueta announced a startling decision.
In the commercial history of the United States and even the world,
Never before has a business analysis caused such shock, commotion, and debate as that of the Coca-Cola Company.
Commotion and debate.
Goizueta said:
"Even the best can be better.
"He Yi Bu:"
After 99 years of development,
The Coca-Cola Company decided to abandon its immutable
traditional recipe,
Because consumers now prefer sweeter soft drinks.
In order to cater to this change in market demand,
Coca-Cola
decided to change the formula and adjust the taste.
Introducing the new generation of Coca-Cola.
1. Background and process of analysis
Until the mid-1970s,
The Coca-Cola Company was the undisputed leader in the American beverage market.
However,
From 1976 to 1979,
Coca-Cola's market growth plummeted from an annual increase of 13% to 2%.
In stark contrast to this,
Grasping the nine aspects of analyzing problems
Yes,
Pepsi is coming on strong,
Exceptionally popular.
It first launched the "Pepsi New Generation" series of advertisements.
Directly targeting the largest consumer group in the beverage market.
Aiming the promotion directly at the largest consumer group in the beverage market—
young people.
After the first round of advertising blitz was a great success,
following its success,
PepsiCo continues to keep a close eye on young people,
continuing to desperately strengthen Pepsi's "youth image," and launched a second round of advertising called the "Pepsi Challenge."
In this round of advertising campaign,
PepsiCo boldly live-streamed the taste test with customers,
namely:
Without informing the participants that they were filming an advertisement,
Ask them to taste various beverages without brand logos,
and then say which one tastes the best.
The entire experiment is broadcast live.
Pepsi Cola's adventure was a success.
After almost every test,
tasters thought Pepsi tasted better.
"Pepsi
The "Pepsi Challenge" series of commercials increased Pepsi's market share in the US beverage market from 6% to 14%.
Coca-Cola didn't believe it could be true.
The company immediately organized taste tests.
The results were the same as in the "Pepsi Challenge":
People preferred the taste of Pepsi.
Research by the Coca-Cola Company's market research department shows that
The pattern of Coca-Cola dominating the beverage market is transforming into a new pattern of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola standing side by side.
According to data released by the Coca-Cola Company's market research department,
In 1972,
18% of soft drink consumers only recognize Coca-Cola as a brand.
Only 4% of consumers insist on drinking Pepsi.
The situation will be very different in 10 years.
Only 12% of consumers are loyal to Coca-Cola.
The proportion of consumers who insist on only drinking Pepsi and no other beverages is almost

Carefully verify your answer. City 225
On par with Coca-Cola,
Reached 11%1
What Coca-Cola is most annoyed about is:
Coca-Cola spends $100 million more on advertising each year than Pepsi-Cola,
The number of Coca-Cola vending machines is twice that of Pepsi-Cola,
Coca-Cola has more sales outlets than Pepsi.
Coca-Cola's prices are more competitive than Pepsi's...
…
But why is Coca-Cola's market share continuing to decline?
2. Goizueta's Analysis
In 1980,
Paul Austin, the chairman of Coca-Cola, was nearing retirement,
and it was widely believed that Donald Keough, the president of Coca-Cola's US operations, would become chairman.
But, unexpectedly,
Paul's successor was Roberto Goizueta.
Goizueta's background was very different from that of traditional Coca-Cola senior analysts.
He wasn't from Georgia,
or even American,
He is Cuban,
the son of a wealthy sugar mill owner in Havana.
At the age of 16,
Goicoueta was sent to the United States by his father,
He attended a prestigious boarding school in Connecticut.
When he first arrived in the United States,
Goizueta couldn't even speak English,
but he quickly learned English by looking up words in the dictionary and watching movies.
And in the end, he also took the stage as a graduate representative to deliver a farewell speech.
In 1955,
Goizueta graduated from Yale University,
and returned to Cuba with his Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering.
At this time, Goizueta already looked down on his father's sugar mill.
He chose Coca-Cola's research laboratory in Cuba.
In 1959,
Castro took power in Cuba,
and massively confiscated foreign assets in Cuba,
Goizueta was forced to abandon his rather comfortable wealthy life in Cuba,
and fled to the United States with his wife and 3 children.
When the plane landed,
Goizueta had only $20 left in his pocket.
The Coca-Cola Company secretly recruited Goizueta.
He did not let The Coca-Cola Company down.
This nearly destitute Cuban was completely loyal to The Coca-Cola Company.
Quickly became a capable person.
In 1968,
he was transferred to Coca-Cola headquarters,
and began to participate in high-level analysis work.
Austin, the retiring chairman, had intended to choose a successor from outside Coca-Cola headquarters.
But Coca-Cola's old guard,
90-year-old Robert Woodruff, put pressure on Austin,
forcing him to nominate Goizueta as chairman of Coca-Cola.
226 Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing weaknesses
At the beginning of his tenure,
Goizueta convened a global managers meeting of The Coca-Cola Company,
claiming that The Coca-Cola Company had nothing to be complacent about
He demanded that all managers accept this reality—
—
Coca-Cola had to change.
The new leader of Coca-Cola announced that the company had entered a new era of change,
The breakthrough of the change was chosen as what was once sacred and inviolable for Coca-Cola,
But now, the formula that hasn't changed since '99 can't adapt to the changing times.
3. Market research
Despite Coca-Cola's huge advertising spending,
Advanced distribution methods,
Wide network coverage,
But from the late 1970s to the early 1980s,
its market share had been declining.
So the company decided to look for the cause from the product itself.
All indications suggest that
Changes in taste are one of the most important reasons for the decline in Coca-Cola's market share.
This formula, kept secret since 1999, no longer seems to match the taste of today's consumers.
Therefore,
In 1982, The Coca-Cola Company implemented "Project Kansas."
'"Project Kansas" was the code name for a secret market research operation conducted by The Coca-Cola Company.'
During this market research,
The Coca-Cola Company deployed 2,000 investigators.
A survey was conducted in 10 major cities to investigate whether customers were willing to accept a brand new Coca-Cola.
Surveyors presented customers with questionnaires containing a series of questions.
Customers were asked to answer the questions on the spot.
For example,
There is a question:
A new ingredient will be added to the Coca-Cola recipe,
to make it taste smoother,
would you like that? Another question is:
If Coca-Cola tasted similar to Pepsi,
would you feel uneasy? Would you like to try the new drink?
According to the survey results,
The market research department of Coca-Cola Company obtained the following data:
Only 10% to 12% of customers expressed concerns about the new Coke flavor,
and half of them thought they would get used to the new Coke in the future.
This shows that customers are willing to try the new Coke flavor.
The Coca-Cola Company's technical department is determined to develop a completely new taste,
A more pleasant Coca-Cola.
In September 1984,
They finally came up with a sample.
This new drink was sweeter than the original Coca-Cola,
Fewer bubbles,
It has a smooth and slightly gummy texture,
This is because it uses more grain essence than sucrose.
The Coca-Cola Company organized a taste test,
Without informing the tasters of the beverage brands,
ask them to say which beverage is more satisfying.
The test results thrilled the Coca-Cola Company,
顾
Chapter Eight: Aspect Eight:
Carefully verify your answer. Coin 227
Customer satisfaction with New Coke exceeded that of Pepsi.
In previous taste tests,
Pepsi always beat Coca-Cola.
Coca-Cola's market researchers believe that
This new formula of Coca-Cola could increase the company's share of the beverage market by at least one percentage point,
Which means an additional $200 million in sales!
To be on the safe side,
Coca-Cola invested another $4 million in an even larger taste test.
191,000 customers in 13 major cities participated in the test.
Among the many unlabeled cola beverages,
tasters still preferred New Coke.
Highly favored,
55% of tasters said the taste of New Coke was better than the traditional formula Coke,
and in this test, New Coke once again beat Pepsi.
4. The Launch of "New Coke"
New Coca-Cola is about to go into production,
But now the Coca-Cola Company is facing a new problem:
Should they add a production line for "New Coke",
or completely replace traditional Coca-Cola with "New Coke"?
Coca-Cola's analysis suggests that
A new production line has been added.
The taste of young people,
Is separate from Coca-Cola.
吕
This will definitely be opposed by bottlers all over the world (Coca-Cola produces Coca-Cola syrup in the United States,
then ships it all over the world to be bottled and sold locally.
Those who are engaged in this bottling of Coca-Cola are bottlers), because it will increase the cost of bottlers.
After repeated weighing,
The Coca-Cola Company decided to replace traditional Coke with "New Coke,"
and cease production and sales of traditional Coke.
April 23, 1985,
Goizueta held a press conference at Lincoln Center in New York City.
228 M Nine aspects of Mei analyzing problems
A grand press conference,
Officially announced that "New Coke" replaced traditional Coca-Cola on the market.
The Coca-Cola Company sent invitations to all American news media,
More than 200 newspaper
magazine and television reporters attended the press conference.
The news spread like lightning across America.
Within 24 hours,
81% of Americans knew about Coca-Cola changing its formula.
This proportion is higher than the proportion of the public who knew about the Apollo moon landing in July 1969 within 24 hours.
In the early days of the "New Coke" launch,
the market reaction was very good.
150 million people tasted "New Coke" on the day it was released.
No new product in history has ever had so many buyers on the day of its release.
The amount of Coke syrup sent to bottlers around the country was also the highest in 5 years.
5. Consequences of Decisions
The situation suddenly changed.
While Coca-Cola Company anticipated that some people would be against "New Coke" replacing the traditional Coke
See,
But unexpectedly, the opposition was so overwhelming.
Within 4 hours of the launch of "New Coke,"
The Coca-Cola Company received 650 protest calls.
By mid-May,
The company was receiving as many as 5,000 critical calls per day.
Moreover, there was an avalanche of protest letters.
Coca-Cola had to open 83 hotlines.
They hired more public relations staff to handle these complaints and criticisms.
Some customers called Coca-Cola a symbol of America.
Is an old friend of the Americans,
But now suddenly abandoned.
Some customers even threatened to switch to tea,
Never again

In Seattle,
A group of people loyal to traditional Coca-Cola formed the "Old Cola Drinkers of America" organization.
Prepare to launch a campaign to boycott "New Coke" nationwide.
Many people began searching for the discontinued traditional Coca-Cola.
The price of these "old Cokes" rose again and again.
By mid-June,
Sales of "New Coke" were far below Coca-Cola's expectations.
Many bottlers strongly demanded a return to selling traditional Coca-Cola.
Coca-Cola's market research department went out again.
An emergency survey of the market was conducted.
As a result, they found that
Before May 30th, 53% of customers claimed to like "New Coke", but by June,
more than half of the people said they didn't like "New Coke".
By July,
Only 30% of people had something good to say about "New Coke."
Anger continued to spread across America.
The media continued to fan the flames.
The media portrayed the love for the 99-year-old traditional recipe as a symbol of patriotism.
Robert Antonio, a sociology professor at the University of Kansas, said:
"Many people felt that the Coca-Cola Company had desecrated a sacred symbol."
"Even Goizueta's father came out to criticize 'New Coke,' even threatening to disown his son."
Coca-Cola's analysts had to seriously consider the seriousness of the problem.
In a board meeting,
Goizueta decided to hold off on taking action for the time being,
until the fourth weekend in June,
to see what changes there would be in sales by then.
But by the end of June,
the sales of "New Coke" still showed no signs of improvement,
while public protests grew more and more intense.
So,
Coca-Cola decided to resume production of the traditional formula.
Its trademark was named Coca-Cola Classic.
At the same time,
"New Coke" will continue to be retained and produced, and its trademark is New Coke.
July 11,
Goizueta led senior executives of Coca-Cola Company to apologize to the public under the Coca-Cola logo.
And announced the immediate resumption of production of Coca-Cola with the traditional recipe.
When the news came,
The United States was in an uproar.
ABC interrupted its Wednesday afternoon programming,
and immediately broadcast the news from Coca-Cola.
All media outlets reported the good news of "Old Coke's" return as headline news.
Democratic Senator David Pryor is still giving a speech in the Senate,
saying:
"This is a very meaningful moment in American history,
It shows that some national spirits are unchangeable.
"Wall Street also cheered Coca-Cola's decision."
"The return of 'Coke Classic' has enabled Coca-Cola"
Nine Aspects of Mastering Analytical Questioning
The company's stock price climbed to a 12-year high.
Roger Enrico, President of Pepsi-Cola's U.S. operations, said:
"Coca-Cola's launch of 'New Coke' was a disastrous mistake."
It's the 'Edsel' of the 1980s.
”
6. Analysis of Decision-Making Errors
Before the launch of "New Coke,"
The Coca-Cola Company took extra precautions in its preparation.
It took two years,
And cost $4 million.
Surveyed nearly 200,000 consumers,
And the survey results being "both reasonable and beneficial," it seemed logical to analyze and launch "New Coke,"
impeccable.
But why did the outcome turn out to be the opposite of what was predicted?
The market research conducted by Coca-Cola seemed perfectly logical:
The company decided to launch a new flavor of Coke,
It should, of course, first conduct taste tests among consumers.
This "New Coke" was victorious in comparisons with both "Old Coke" and Pepsi,
Explains that it is a competitive flagship product that suits customer tastes.
Catering to market demand,
It should naturally be a great success after it is put into production.
However,
Coca-Cola's research department overlooked an important step when designing questionnaires and taste tests,
which is that they didn't tell the respondents:
If you choose one Coke,
then you will lose other Cokes.
However, those surveyed invariably believed that "New Coke" was a supplement to the existing "Old Coke."
It was definitely not a replacement for "Old Coke."
The investigators and those surveyed did not agree on the basic framework.
In addition,
Coca-Cola market researchers saw Xiao Shi Cola's aggressive growth in recent years.
Therefore, they subjectively believed that customers preferred sweeter-tasting Coke.
So,
They positioned the difference between "New Coke" and "Old Coke" on being "sweeter."
In conducting taste tests,
they mostly selected young people as test subjects.
This seems reasonable,
because young people are the largest customer base in the soft drink market.
Taste tests conducted in this context,
further lured Coca-Cola into the "sweeter" misconception of launching "New Coke" from two aspects:
On the one hand,
young people prefer sweeter tastes than middle-aged and elderly people,
Of course, they would vote for "New Coke";
On the other hand,
when people taste something without being told the brand,
they are more nervous.
他
Chapter 8, Aspect 8:
Carefully verify your answers 231
They were afraid that testers would laugh at their lack of taste sensitivity,
and unable to taste the special qualities of the new product.
So,
When tasters sampled "New Coke," which was noticeably sweeter than existing colas,
the test subjects immediately reacted,
saying they liked the flavor
To show that his sense of taste is sensitive.
The Coca-Cola Company's preconceived notions were once again validated by "undeniable" market research results,
于
The result was the introduction of "New Coke," which had a sweeter taste.
In reality,
Pepsi Cola rose to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
At that time, the children born during the baby boom in the United States had grown up.
Forming a strong consumer group for sweet-flavored beverages.
But starting in the mid-1980s,
The American society is aging,
and the middle-aged and elderly customer base that loves traditional flavors is constantly expanding.
Meanwhile,
the concept of healthy eating is becoming increasingly popular.
People began to avoid oily foods.
Foods high in sugar.
Therefore,
the sweeter-tasting "New Coke" seemed a bit out of touch with the times.
A product with a 99-year history and widespread popularity is no longer a simple commodity.
It should have formed a certain culture,
and become a certain symbol.
But this cultural connotation and symbolic value are deeply hidden in the hearts of customers.
You must consciously and carefully design the questionnaire to investigate their position or weight in the customer's heart.
If you simply ask customers:
If the Coke formula changes,
are you willing to drink more,
Fewer,
or the same amount of Coke as before? Then it is impossible to deeply probe the customer's innermost feelings about the product,
nor can it detect the influence of the product's intrinsic value.
Analyzing rashly at this time,
Of course, mistakes will happen.

Motivation usually refers to the encouragement of positive actions.
Even if mistakes occur at work,
the way to motivate is not through criticism,
Instead, help them learn from their mistakes.
And make improvements,
To avoid making the same mistakes in the future.
However,
It is wrong to confuse positive encouragement with indulgence.
If a person repeatedly...
...refuses to learn from their mistakes,
they will inevitably make the same...
An avoidable mistake.
In this case,
Strict requirements are motivation.
This is not only for himself,
And it's for every other person too.
In this situation,
Do not
Blame or complain about others in public.
Especially, don't do it in front of those people—

They really resent the person who made the mistake,
Or in front of people who made the same mistake.
Reproach them in person.
Otherwise,
it will have a negative impact.
The person who made the mistake should be taken aside,
and you should tell them your views on the matter.
Explain that you want them to make significant improvements.
As long as your actions help them achieve greater results,
Even someone who repeatedly makes mistakes,
May be motivated to work actively.
However, the greater reward lies in the motivation of other members of the team,

When it comes to motivation,
Most people focus on dealing with problems with subordinates
We sometimes think about boosting the morale of our superiors,
but rarely consider motivating our peers.
In reality,
there are many opportunities for motivation in this area:
People have discovered that
at every stage of life,
interacting with people who have similar experiences,

is very beneficial,
In fact,
your peers are this support group within the company.
Peer encouragement,

Wherever you feel it's inappropriate to directly reward someone at the same level,
you can pat them on the back,
to show your appreciation.
Or praise them for something they just did,
Just say a few words of appreciation,
This can produce a wonderful motivating effect.
As people say at academic awards,
Nothing is more important than gaining recognition from peers.
When thinking about inspiring peers,
remember that doing so is mutually beneficial.
It's not just you helping others,
Conversely, others will help you too.

This lottery event is the fashion of the Spanish.
This lottery is drawn every time,
And that Christmas
The prize money for that issue of Christmas is the largest lottery prize to date.
Its entire activity
Publicly broadcast on television,
The lottery winners celebrated all night long.
To emphasize that the lottery was not rigged (i.e., purely random sampling), boys were specially invited from an orphanage in Madrid to
draw the lucky tickets.
Spanish news media asked one of the big winners:
'"How did you identify it? Did you know how it would be that particular lottery ticket?" he replied,'
He kept searching relentlessly,
until he found one with the last two digits being 4B before stopping.
When asked, "Why 48 as the last digits?" he replied:
"Because for 7 nights,
I've been having insomnia,
so the number I dreamed of is 7, and 7×7 is 48…
…
"
This story is hilarious.
The winner himself doesn't understand how to do multiplication.
And he is destined to not understand that the thing he is so proud of is actually pure chance.
He is a victim of so-called "fantasy of control."
In this section,
We will examine the biases that force us to misinterpret experience,
and how to overcome them.
If you can understand where your biases lie,
and know how to generate good feedback,
And be able to pragmatically interpret the return,
You can continuously transform your experience into reliable knowledge.
You may find differences in two situations,
One is to make you move forward steadily,
To have a long career:
The other is to make the same mistake,
History repeats itself.
Learning from experience is not something that can be learned.
It takes profound skill to accomplish this.
At the end of the day,
Experience can only provide data,
not knowledge.
It provides learning materials.
Only when people understand how to evaluate information,
and know what they represent,
can it be transformed into knowledge.
People don't learn from experience as easily as you might expect—
'—not even those who are intelligent and highly motivated.'

Even those who are intelligent and highly motivated are no exception.
For example,
A study by a clinical psychologist showed that

Almost all winners have made careful choices,
But why shouldn't he believe that his own wisdom led to his success this time? Because in this case,
The obvious fact is that,
The underlying process is a genuine coincidence.
However, once there is a slight element of skill in the victory,
Its success is mainly attributed to opportunity rather than talent.
Nevertheless,
Only by understanding the role of opportunity in success
can you learn which of your actions should be carefully repeated,
and which should be improved.
False complacency is one of the biggest obstacles to learning.
All of us should know that,
We have some control over the environment in which we live.
For example, experiments have shown that,
Dental patients who have been told they have the right to turn off a switch to stop the drilling machine
feel more relaxed and comfortable than those who have not been given this control—
—
even if people do not exercise the right to switch the switch they are holding.
In another study,
Two groups of experimental workers were assigned to the same distracting background noise test.
One group was told that
they could stop the noise at any time.
Although they never touched the control switch,
the group with control performed better than the group without control.
This illusion of control often forces us to repeat actions that have been successful in the past.
Even when there is absolutely no reason to believe that these actions are related to success.
That's how it is.
Early 19th century,
Geng Zhou immigrants encountered a group of Native Americans in present-day Iowa who depended entirely on bison for their livelihood.
These bison roamed around in herds.
Whenever the bison wandered far away,
this group of Native Americans would go hungry.
The reaction to this situation
is that the tribe's warriors dance a carefully choreographed bison dance day and night,
with one group dancing until exhausted and then replaced by another,
until the bison return.
In the end, the wild bison always turns back.
This tribe interprets this phenomenon as empirical evidence of the Bison Dance effect.
In modern society, how many activities are similar to this Bison Dance—a series of rituals and even superstitions are held on how to prepare for major issues?
This illusion of control and the resulting complacency about the originating results have firmly entrenched various biases.

2. Find a reason to step down
Although when planning an action versus reviewing a proven successful action,
people eagerly overestimate their power of control,
but when reviewing a proven very poor action,
the vast majority of people also have an instinct to underestimate their mistakes.
In order to avoid the pain of admitting mistakes,
we will find reasons to step down.
We might be:
(1) Distorting our memories of what we actually did or said;
(2) Unrealistically complaining about the mistakes of others,
or hypothetical unpredictable
situations;
(3) Saying that our original predictions were misunderstood or misinterpreted;
(4) Change our current preferences,
Therefore, failure doesn't seem to matter anymore (for example, after being fired,

A report that will fail,
Then at least you need to record in a file that the boss can't see what different approach you will take next time.
Finding reasons to step down is usually compelled by our internal needs,
rather than saying that a real need must be expressed to others in this way.
Most people like to think that they are the cause of successful outcomes,
but when things prove to be bad,
they like to find reasons to shirk responsibility.
Therefore, they all suffer from an attribution bias that can undermine useful feedback.
In short,
They believe that:
Success is due to skill,
and failure is due to bad luck.
This is perhaps the most common case of interpreting experiences with self-interest at the center.

"Victory has a thousand fathers,
but defeat is like an orphan."

What actions can you take? First, you must be self-disciplined—
—
willing to remain objective as much as possible.
Acknowledge that making some mistakes is unavoidable,
A person who never makes mistakes is unlikely to achieve great things.
Then,
Try to accurately isolate your real mistakes from opportunity problems in the following ways:
(1) Clearly set standards or key process tables in advance,
Define success in this way,
Or do a target analysis—
—
Clearly list the results you expect or fear—
—
Mark those results that you can at least objectively judge with predictive ability.
(2) To what extent should it be specified in advance?

the outcome of your efforts.
(3) Ask others who are not involved in the plan,
How much of your success or failure do they think you should be praised or criticized for your actions (before or after knowing the outcome)?
(4) For repetitive analyses, see if statistical tests can be used to determine how much chance plays a role in the results,
How much does chance account for in the results?
And what is the proportion of wise choices.
(5) Periodically list the failures you have encountered.
If this list is too comprehensive,
Be sure to consult with other people (those who are not so dependent on you).
(6) Carefully analyze the new information obtained from the results of recent plans.
How do they force you to revise the simulation scenarios already prepared for future plans?
4. Hindsight bias analysis when dealing with problems,
to a limited extent,
Thinking about this issue with the benefit of hindsight might provide a clearer understanding.
But generally speaking,
hindsight understanding is an illusion,
which often hinders people,
Learning from experience,
is like being complacent about success and making excuses to shirk responsibility for mistakes.
And far more dangerous than other types of biases
is that,
The danger of hindsight is not something that can be avoided simply through objective intentions.
They are not only deeply rooted in our desires,
but also firmly entrenched in the basic workings of our minds—
most of which are beyond our rational control.
They will force us to take measures to prevent bad effects at the very beginning of the analysis.
We must take measures to prevent bad influences from the very beginning of the analysis.
A study by Baruch Fischhoff and Ruth Beyth showed hindsight
242= l= The nine aspects of the meta-analysis problem
Obvious deviation from strong motivation.
Before US President Richard Nixon's visit to China and the Soviet Union in 1972,
They asked students to consider some possible outcomes:
(1) The United States will establish a permanent diplomatic mission in Beijing,
But without diplomatic recognition;
(2) Mao Zedong would meet with President Nixon at least once;
(3) Nixon would meet with Soviet authorities,
and so on.
The students were asked to list the percentage chance of each possible outcome.
Following Nixon's visit,
These participating students were asked to assess the likelihood of these different outcomes.
They were also asked to recall and reconstruct the original percentages they had listed.
Because the interval between the two tests was only two weeks,
67% believed that their original estimated answers were closer to the truth than when they actually signed.
For example,
the hindsight bias percentage of remembering Nixon meeting Mao Zedong is higher than the percentage actually answered before the visit (because students already knew that Nixon had met Mao Zedong).
After a period of 4 to 8 months (and even fewer people can actually recall their original probability percentage), as many as 84% of people exhibit hindsight bias.
Why does hindsight bias exist? Our brains don't simply archive information as it comes, like a filing cabinet.
Instead, they heavily prune and edit the information they absorb,
cutting it into pieces.
Synthesize and summarize.
Adding new information to old knowledge,
The new and old are mixed together,
Therefore, it is impossible to reverse the process and decompose the two.
Before people knew that Nixon met with Mao Zedong during his visit to China,
People really can't imagine how they will communicate.
Similarly,
adults can draw like he did at the age of 4.
People don't easily free themselves from what they've learned.
Hindsight can cause people to miss the significance of major analysis,
and it can also lead to misunderstandings of the problem itself.
Therefore, it hurts those who are consultants or coaching experts.
The phenomenon of hindsight suggests that you should put all agreements in writing.
This is what lawyers have been carefully trained to do, whether they like it or not.
Other specialized professions have not yet required this.
If there is no written record to check,
New information emerges every day,
People will naturally have confusing agreements as well.

5. How to overcome your internal obstacles in learning
In a rapidly changing environment,
Slow learning will ruin you, although in science new learning can only progress slowly,
But competitive people can't wait that long.
Fortunately,
you can minimize the biases we have introduced,
Just remember these dangers and strive to overcome them:
(1) Regarding successes gained by chance,
Don't fall into the trap of complacency.
When you succeed at something,
Think about it honestly,
which of your actions contributed to your success,
and which might not have.
When you are doing the assessment,
You can ask other people for assistance.
(2) When you fail,
Avoid making excuses to step down.
If you exaggerate the importance of misfortune in your failure,
Then you would miss one of the most significant opportunities in your entire professional career:
The chance to learn from failures that you inevitably have to experience.
When you get feedback from unpleasant analysis,
Discuss its importance with others.
Review the simulated scenarios you have created for the future,
and decide whether they should be changed.
(3) Use the expectations recorded during major analyses
to minimize hindsight bias.
Then compare the actual results with what you expected.
Consider what lessons you should learn from it.

The results of actions often persist in a state of uncertainty.
For example,
You approve a budget request from the research department,
then you may have to wait several years before the results of your actions are revealed.
By that time,
you have been transferred to another position in the organization,
You may never know if the department did anything useful with the funds.
Or your actions are shrouded in a vague relationship with the final outcome.
You can never tell if you did right or wrong,
even if you've made an effort to avoid making excuses.
For example,
Suppose you increase the budget for the research department,
and they do discover something useful.
Could you say that the increase in budget is the reason for the discovery? Or could the discovery have happened unintentionally? To reach a consistent academic
Xi,
Most people not only need to figure out their own biases,
but also need to improve the quality of feedback they receive.
1. What's wrong with the feedback we're getting now?
In order to improve the quality of the factual evidence that experience brings us,
We should understand from the beginning what is wrong with the feedback we are receiving.
Then,
we can seize the opportunity to overcome each major problem.
Most people's experiences suffer from the following problems:
(1) Unobtainable feedback:
Lack of information on key issues;
(2) Entangled feedback:
Factual evidence has been analyzed by the analyst and his colleagues in preliminary judgment.

(3) Confusing Feedback:
Uncontrollable and unpredictable factors—
—
- Random noise affecting the results of the analysis:
(4) Ignored Feedback:
Incompletely utilizing information that is already available.
2. Treatment effect:
Entangled feedback
We often do so in ways that make it difficult to determine the quality of the analysis itself.
To influence the results of our analysis.
Although these methods have their reasons,
But later they will interfere
with the analysis of the results and the efforts made in learning.
Researchers call these confounding factors treatment effects.
A "treatment" is anything done after a judgment
that can affect the outcome of that judgment.
对
A common form of treatment effect is the self-fulfilling prophecy:
The fulfillment of a prophecy is not only due to the quality of the prediction itself,
but also due to the actions taken by someone who believes in it.
This result is usually worth having.
But the price of increasing its sequential probability,
That is, your feedback is distorted.
There was an article in "Bartender" magazine,
guiding how to predict generous tippers based on the drinks they order.
The best tippers are considered to be those who order Scotch with ice or Russian vodka.
Or people who order straight bourbon or French brandy.
246 h= Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
And those who order Grasshopper cocktails,
Pink Squirrels and Alexander brandies,
Then they are considered to be more stingy.
But servers who are trying to predict potential big tippers,
Might give special service to those they expect to be big tippers.
They are thinking:
"Why waste time on a miserly person?" It's not surprising that
Those favored customers tend to leave larger tips.
Is it because the waiters accurately recognize the generous tippers,
or simply because they give certain customers better service?
Or consider the effect of a training program.
A company-sponsored training program might improve the success rate of new hires with a 50% chance of success to 80%, but all HR managers will understand that
80 out of 100 new hires in the company are successful.
But from these statistics,
Managers cannot know if this success rate is due to:
① A great hiring rule (followed by a worthless training program): ② A super good training program (selecting mediocre novices with light analysis,
and greatly improving the relationship): ③ A pragmatic hiring rule and a combination of an efficient training program.
The "treatment effect" is often unconscious.
This bias can even cause greater damage to learning.
Managers may not realize that they or their secretarial assistants are favoring a new employee. Supervisors may be unclear.
They may monitor the work of some subordinates they don't trust more closely than others.
And that is the real reason why they always find that certain people make more mistakes.
Employees often can't understand either,
They are dodging those with lower education levels,
or those colleagues they consider inferior.
Waiters are always confused,
They are neglecting the kind of customers they consider to be misers.
A study of elementary school teachers illustrates how a prophecy can subtly become self-fulfilling.
The teachers were told that
some of their students were "late bloomers," meaning that a tutoring test recently administered showed they had great potential.
In reality,
their performance on the tests was neither better nor worse than the other students in the class,
just average. The only difference was
that their teacher had already determined their intelligence.

Power has the potential to be developed.
Nevertheless,
These "late bloomers" soon far surpassed the other students in the class.
In any case,
these teachers have caused this unfounded prophecy to come true (we know that,
when teachers think these students are promising talents,
they are more likely to give caring looks,
Smile,
Nod,
or other non-verbal expressions of acknowledgment).
Perhaps there is no better place to recognize the self-fulfilling prophecy than in a job interview.
Interviewers form their impressions from reading resumes,
and then look for factual evidence to support those impressions when they interview them.
In a study,
interviewers were told (chosen randomly) that,
A personality quiz revealed that the person they were interviewing was neither warm nor cold in personality.

After the interview,
They described the candidate's personality as if it were being guided.

The results of almost any analysis are affected by uncontrollable and unpredictable factors that scientists call random noise.
If you're planning to open a new hamburger restaurant,
You just can't anticipate some problems:
such as the bad weather in the year you opened,
the government releases a report discouraging people from eating hamburgers,
or encountering an unforeseen economic depression.

Most of these factors are random noise.
The appearance of random noise makes people find reasons to avoid failure,
while taking great pride in successes to which they contributed little.
However, some people are also able to blame themselves for failures caused by random factors,
and are self-effacing about successes achieved with a small amount of luck and a large amount of skill.
If you do the same type of analysis many times,
then random factors may not matter much; they won't affect your long-term success rate.
But most of our extremely important analyses only have one chance to be done.

The vast majority also ignore or even destroy a large amount of useful information,
This information could help them understand whether their analysis is wise,

Then he added,
Only those products that appear likely to succeed in initial market testing,
would his company rigorously conduct national marketing tests on.
The company did not try to refine
Chapter 9, aspect 9;
Correct your answer One 249
Accurately identify the root causes of why other products failed in initial testing.
In the initial marketing tests,
the company accumulated a wealth of information about what customers really think.
But some of the feedback was systematized,
while some was ignored.
Ignoring and abusing feedback is quite common.
An advisor who is subject to welfare social service organizations,
His task is to assist in obtaining more relief funds.
The advisor initially wanted to understand what the experience of a successful relief fund application was.
He went to the agency's filing cabinet to look for it,
but only found that all of its unsuccessful applications—
about 90% of all applications—
—
had been destroyed.
People often overlook the important feedback that their failures can bring.
This is because the feedback from successful analyses seems more important in some ways.
5. Regular learning analysis
Regular learning analysis helps overcome the lack of feedback,
The endowment effect,
Random indoles,
Ignored feedback,
And other innate biases, a crucial step.
In regular learning analysis,
the question you need to answer is,
"From recent experience,
What have I learned (compared to what I should have learned)?" It forces you to find reasonable conclusions
Deeply imprint the lessons you've learned from your experience in your mind,
and enable you to strategically plan your future learning.
Generally speaking,
Learning analytics should be done in a meeting format,
Started working with a few colleagues (of course, this doesn't mean that a group of junior analysts without subordinates can't do self-analysis,
or be allowed to do it while drinking beer after work).
Significant lessons learned in recent months,
"may still be vivid in your mind when you set out to find them (“The market is no longer price-sensitive…”
…
"."
"Company X is already manufacturing a product of higher quality than ours…"
…
")."
Let's analyze it further...
Since the last review,
The basic questions you've learned,
You need to add the following related questions:
(1) What have I learned from my own framework?
(2) In the way we collect intelligence for analysis,
What did I learn?
(3) What did I learn in the process of reaching our final conclusion?
(4) Generally speaking,
Are we still satisfied with our analysis process? Furthermore,
We should also talk about some obstacles to learning.
Including:
250 Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
(1) In my work process, which lessons were learned naturally? Which ones were learned through special effort?
(2) What additional feedback would improve my learning? For example,
Suppose I keep a more detailed and complete record of all my beliefs throughout the analysis process,
Estimates,
predicted,
and other things.
And what information in this record allows me to learn the most from what actually happened? If this record system changes,
will I still be able to find this information in the future?
(3) Have we appropriately utilized the information retained by the organization (such as archived memos from past analysis processes)? What items in our current record regulations are redundant?
(4) If our competitors study us in a systematic way,
So, what about them and me?
My analysis,
Or how much can my organization understand? Have I inadvertently leaked any information that would make it easy for them to obtain?
The completion phase of a plan may be the most natural time to do a learning analysis.
If you want to continue doing analysis,
you can do an analysis once or twice a year—
—
or perhaps do it at the same time as the standard performance evaluation.
The structure and frequency of learning analysis should vary depending on the individual situation.
However, everyone must do some form of learning analytics work within a certain period.
6. Experiment:
Designed feedback
In addition to keeping more complete records and more careful analysis,
Can you improve feedback? The answer is yes.
For example,
You can use experiments to get better feedback.
If you are a mid-level manager at a company,
In principle,
You can hire all 200 applicants in an experiment.
Get feedback that is impossible to obtain from the recruitment analysis (or a more realistic scenario where 50 normally qualified candidates are hired out of 100 positions,
and 50 candidates who would normally be rejected are hired).
By using this method,
You will get a full reward of 100 points.
Use it to judge the quality of the original analysis rules.
If the test not only tests the validity of the rules you use,
But also takes into account the importance of "treatment" generated by the training course.
Then you can divide the 50 people who would have been admitted into two groups.
25 people will receive the original training courses.
The other 25 people will be assigned to work directly without pre-job training (or given some lower-cost training).
Chapter Nine, Section Nine:
Revise your answer 251
But,
like this
Is an experiment like this worth it? This kind of experiment
is usually considered crazy.
The HR manager's job is to find ways to hire the most suitable candidates.
If they have to,
they hire candidates whom they consider to be inferior;
they would feel derelict in their duties.
But from this experiment,
you will be able to understand where your analysis is actually good,
and know how to establish a better analysis rule.
Next,
In the time to come,
You can be more effective.
Choose new employees more efficiently.
In other words,
If this experiment can bring you some useful experience,
And better analysis rules,
Your success rate in analyzing problems will increase.
Therefore,
What you face is a trade-off between short-term and long-term goals.
From this point of view,
It seems that the previously eliminated candidates for household use are not so crazy anymore.
But to conduct a comprehensive experiment,
the cost may still be too high to be feasible.
This analysis should basically include a cost/benefit analysis, including long-term benefits.
For example,
You might want to try a smaller experiment—
—
Perhaps only hire 20 people who were originally going to be laid off.
7. Process relative to outcome:
Probability of heads or tails for a coin
Sometimes you can't get direct feedback on the results of an analysis,
or you can,
but you can't get it in time
Therefore, it is of no benefit to you.
Or in a special case,
The result depends half on chance (random noise) and half on the quality of your analysis.
Without distinction.
In these situations,
you don't have to focus on learning from the results,
but on learning through the analysis of the analysis itself.
In fact,
If
252 i Grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
The result depends on both your analysis and luck,
Then the feedback from reviewing your analysis process can help you,
will be far more than the feedback from reviewing its results.
Therefore,
a prudent review of the analysis process is a significant part of obtaining analytical feedback.
Many people fail to learn from the research and analysis process,
It is because they irrationally mix their preference for someone with good results.
Please consider the following questions:
A person has to choose between two coins,
If either coin comes up tails,
Not a single cent will be obtained;
If it appears on the front,
You can get 1 million US dollars.
● Coin A has a 50% chance of success (heads).
Coin B has a 60% chance of success (heads).
Naturally,
people will choose coin B.
Now suppose two coins are tossed.
Coin A lands on heads.
Coin B then lands on tails.
Did this person make the right choice?
What benchmark should be used to decide which coin to choose? Do you want to choose the one with a higher success
of probability,
So, of course, coin B is better.
The best analysis rule is simple:
Choose the coin that has a higher probability of success.
But luck can obscure the connection between good analysis and good results.
Let's consider this same problem described in business terms.
Imagine a company wants to launch one of two potential new products.
Suppose the manager is certain that product A has a 50% chance of success.
Product B has a 60% success rate.
What both products have in common is:
Their success represents the same meaning: earning a profit of $1 million.
If either of the two products
Chapter Nine, Section Nine:
Revise Your Answers 253
If something fails,
it means the company gains nothing.
The company selected sample product B and launched it on the market.
But product B failed,
while product A was launched by a competitor,
and was a great success.
Has the company done the right analysis?
Although the correct analysis done by the company is as clear as a coin toss.
Our judgment is affected by the results,
Even when they know the results are the result of random factors.
American manufacturers in many industries in the United States have found that
Some Japanese companies are often able to bring new technologies to market faster—
—
Or in some form that customers like more—
—
Better than American manufacturers.
It seems there's no reason to say
that Japanese engineers are more competent than American engineers,
or that the special design analysis of the Japanese is difficult to universally promote and apply (these products cover everything from photocopiers to automotive engineering).
It seems the crux of the problem is that the Japanese are more systematic in their analysis process.
Actually, they spent time investing in the early stages of the process,
in order to understand the development potential of existing technologies and the needs of users.
Then,
they developed a simple basic design.
Integrate the process and transform the basic design into a marketable product.
It covers all the minor analyses that need to be done during the transformation process.
As detailed as smoothing the integration manufacturing process.
They make the design analysis process correct.
Sir Sverdlov once advised:
Make quick decisions,
But never mention any reasons.
Your analysis may be correct,
Your reasons are definitely wrong.
Don't reveal your reasoning process (that is, your analysis process), because it may prevent you from being smug about a successful (but purely lucky!) outcome.
In other words,
Play political games to make good luck seem like great skill.
When you face an uncooperative environment—
—
Due to random noise or treatment effects,
When feedback is unknowable or ambiguous,
Learning from experience becomes particularly difficult.
Unfortunately,
This is exactly the situation most people face most of the time.
Nine aspects of interesting problem analysis
Three,
Moving in the Right Direction
In an audit of the analysis,
you should analyze the analysis you yourself have done.
Identify a small number of key steps you should take.
Used to quickly improve your analysis.
Once you determine where a few critical errors are,
you will find your analysis easier to improve.
1. Start by evaluating your time usage
After you have completed the working papers,
ask yourself,
what obstacles are preventing the proper allocation of time?
For example,
Before you properly frame your thinking (perhaps because your boss doesn't understand the importance of a proper framework), do you pretend you've completely framed the problem because you're under pressure? Do you have enough time to do intelligence gathering? Is your record-keeping so poor that you can't learn properly from feedback?
The following is a typical time allocation table based on the information we have collected.
Note the emphasis represented by the increased time spent on framing and learning.
Practice proves that intelligence gathering and drawing conclusions are not unimportant,
Rather, it's about having a good analysis framework.
This is why some of the work in this area can be delegated to others.
2. Review your analysis
After you've assessed your time usage,
On a separate sheet of paper, list your most recent analyses,
including:
(1) At least one analysis that yielded good results for you,
The reason for the good result is that you followed a good analysis process.
(2) There is at least one analysis that makes you suffer adverse consequences.
The adverse consequences are due to a poor analysis process.
Please select a good analysis.
And fill in the analysis evaluation form listed below.
This analysis and assessment requires you to grade yourself (with A,
B,
C,
D,
Evaluate with E or F) to show how well you have avoided each obstacle we have highlighted in the analysis traps.
Aspect Nine of Chapter Nine:
Revise your answer 255
obstacle.
If you believe that certain obstacles do not apply to your specific analysis,
simply write "N/A" under the "Level" item.
Finally,
write down which key problem you overcame to make this analysis so great.
Next,
Make a copy of the analysis and evaluation form,
Fill in a poor analysis.
At the bottom of the table,
Specify which pitfall caused you to fail.
Rate yourself here (from A to F to assess how well you controlled yourself to avoid the pitfalls).
If you want,
You can now continue with the next personal analysis checklist.
However, you may need to fill out a few more analysis and evaluation forms to get the hang of it.
After you have filled out four or five,
You should try answering the Personal Analysis Review Form.
If you don't think you can completely fill out the Personal Analysis Review Form,
Or if there is plenty of time,
please don't mind,
you can always go back,
and fill in a few more analysis and assessment formats.
The more analysis and evaluation formats you fill in,
the less likely the conclusions on your personal analysis review form will be harmed by availability bias.
At the same time,
group review also
Can exert a high degree of effectiveness.
Your workgroup can get together to complete the analysis hierarchy drafts and analysis evaluation formats.
There are two major benefits to group work like this:
The more people, the more forward-looking perspective.
The situation of finding excuses to shirk responsibility also decreases.
People in a group usually feel more managerial and are more likely to complete a task thoroughly.
—
Even if the group has only two people.
256 l Nine aspects of analyzing problems
3. Benefits of personal analysis and review
For example,
A human resources manager at a non-profit organization evaluates a good analysis (hiring an assistant human resources manager) versus a bad analysis (selecting a secretary for a key manager in the organization).
She found that,
While doing that good analysis,
she closely followed each step of the analytical process.
She also learned
how losing track of analytical priorities (in her bad analysis) can ruin a good framework.
And the holistic analysis and review will roughly reveal the key mistakes she herself made.
In that good analysis,
she found that:
(1) She had done a wise metaphysical analysis.
The position of this human resources manager has been redefined to align with the interests of the organization.
The executive understood that this hiring analysis involved seeking a candidate similar to the previous incumbent,
rather than finding someone who could meet the previous job description.
(2) She framed it well.
In the early stages of the analysis,
She expanded the framing issue to make existing employees aware of the importance of this promotion opportunity,
because she wanted to select multiple candidates from existing employees,
so she was extremely careful to ensure that each candidate felt fairly treated.
(3) She did a good job in intelligence gathering.
Pay special attention to avoid overconfidence.
The spirit of fairness contained in the framework can help prevent overconfidence.
Although she is familiar with each candidate,
She still carefully set the review criteria for the position,
and asked a colleague from another department of the agency to interview the first four.
Chapter Nine, Aspect Nine:
Revise Your Answers 257
Preferred candidates.
(4) She created a well-structured selection system.
She used a modified preliminary review rule,
first removing candidates who scored too low in any of the four key rules,
Therefore, the number of people was reduced from 12 to 4.
Then, in the next interview, she used a scoring system,
Its essence belongs to a subjective linear model for making final selections.
In a rough analysis,
She started in a similar way.
Her initial analysis framework was quite good.
She emphasized that she was looking for a candidate who could keep the office running smoothly.
However, at the information gathering level,
She began to experience a lack of framework control.
She then asked an administrative assistant in the department—
—
She will be the collaborator of this new secretary...
—
To provide advice.
The administrative assistant pointed out that among the secretarial job applicants,
only one said her career goal was to be a secretary.
Therefore, the assistant said,
she was afraid that other higher-qualified applicants, after being hired,
They might not stay long and will likely resign soon.
And then it's her again, needing to assist in hiring new people,
And also doing the training to replace the person.
The HR manager wasn't moved by the applicant saying her ambition was to be a secretary.
But she agreed with the administrative assistant's goal—
—
"Find someone who won't quit"—
became a key consideration in the problem framing.
Next,
When she checked the references provided by the applicants,
she only asked questions that confirmed her ideas,
that is, questions that any of the top three candidates could answer regarding their work performance.
In retrospect.
She remembered the former boss of the applicant that her administrative assistant favored.
When they asked:
"Will she get along with her colleagues?" and "Can she draft letters?"
The response seemed to lack "enthusiasm."
But she didn't delve deeper into the binding issue,
Choosing a coping strategy of "ignoring potentially non-conforming information."
And the future boss of this new secretary gave the final choice to the HR manager and her administrative assistant.
The hiring issue this time was not using systematic steps to make the final decision,
On the contrary, the HR manager delegated the decision-making power entirely to the administrative assistant.
She fell into a state of groupthink.
She recalled:
"To avoid conflict,"
I reserved my judgment.
”
The administrative assistant hired the applicant she favored.
But the new secretary performed poorly.
She would argue with others in a "bull in a china shop" manner (including the one who used her line).
Even with political assistants, she couldn't draft a letter that her boss would sign.
This analysis and review shows that,
Groupthink can occur even in a group of just two people—
—
Even when the lower-level person expresses an immature opinion that is not well thought out,
It can also cause problems.
In many organizations,
This situation may not be considered a serious danger,
But for the human resources director of this particular non-profit,
This is a major discovery,
because similar situations are quite common in his organization.
At the same time,
This analysis and audit also tells the HR manager,
her metaphysical analysis,
Framework,
Searching for non-conforming intelligence,
and managing group analysis to identify weaknesses in all aspects.
4. Draw your own conclusions
We don't need to list a long list of analysis and discussion key points as the end of this section.
Instead, you should prepare a list of key items based on your own analysis and review to summarize.
conclude.
From your audit results,
Please list a checklist of 3 to 7 major improvement opportunities based on your own analysis process.
Try to identify the problems you might face in the next 6 to 12 months on your list.
Then do another analysis review one year from now.
If the improvement is disappointing,

Combined with disciplined corrective actions,
There is no doubt that there will be excellent performance.
Perhaps some problems must be established through the concerted efforts of the entire organization.
Of course,
It's a little difficult to do this.
Ideally,
As long as the main person responsible for making mistakes puts in the effort to achieve a good analysis process,
this organization should also
Eagerness to learn and tolerance are essential.
IBM has a famous story.
A department manager, after making a mistake that wasted $5,000,
went in frustration to see Thomas J. Watson, the founder of IBM.
The department manager said:
"Do whatever you want with me,
Fire me.
I deserve it.
”
Waterson replied:
"\"Fire you? I just spent $5,000 to educate you."
”
But many institutions cannot compare with Waterson's enterprise in terms of operation,
We certainly cannot expect them to operate as well as IBM.
But we can use whatever power and free will we have in our organization to
get it back on track.
Only by concentrating all our efforts on analyzing the process used,
and making suggestions for the best improvements,
Major changes usually occur after a long period.

264 Nine Aspects of Plastic Analysis Problems
We know that,
In everyday life, analyzing and dealing with problems is always inseparable from the following procedure:
Clarify the definition of the problem;
Clarify the internal logical relationship of the problem:
Clarify the external connections of the problem;
Clarify the origin of the problem;
Clarify the trend of the problem;
Clarify your capacity reserves for solving such problems;
Be good at writing an outline of your analysis of the problem;
Carefully verify the answer:
Finally, revise your answer,
So that the problem can be completely solved.

First, clarify the definition of the problem.
Have people noticed that
the occurrence of daily problems always has a boundary,
and the setting of this "boundary" depends on the analyst's grasp.
If the "boundary" is well set,
the answer to the question becomes clear in "silence is golden." Let's look at
Chapter 10: Problem Analysis Can Be Programmed 265
A short story:
Fei Fei is a singer in a cultural troupe in an open coastal province.
Her acting skills are not outstanding,
but she considers herself highly talented,
and feels like a hero who hasn't found his place. Seeing her younger sisters of the same age,
One by one, they all became popular,
while I remained unknown,
and couldn't help but feel deeply saddened,
racking my brains to think of ways to become famous.
One day,
Fei Fei had just joined the group,
when she heard the group talking about something.
She asked curiously,
'"What are you discussing?" Little Sun, who usually had a good relationship with her, said to her:'
'"Feifei,'
'the opportunity has come,'
'next month,'
Our region is going to hold a Young Singers Competition.
I heard the finals will even be on TV.
Just think,
if someone gets on TV,
No wonder she became an overnight sensation.
Our group has one spot,
Who wouldn't want to compete for it! Sigh,
Why don't you give it a try?” Fei Fei asked upon hearing this.
Couldn't help but be startled.
Thinking in his heart:
"I've been silent for so many years,
It's time for me to become famous and popular."
In the afternoon,
She knocked on the head of the regiment's door.
The old head of the regiment asked her with a smile:
"Feifei,
"Is there something I can help you with?" Fei Fei said embarrassedly.
"Commander,
"It's been so many years,
I've always been so unknown,
Seeing that my youthful years are about to pass,
Sisters who are about my age are all stronger than me.
Even if I have no merit,
I have made contributions through hard work.
I heard that our region has a spot for a singing competition,
"Can I go?" The old head of the troupe patted her on the shoulder,
saying earnestly,
"Feifei,"
I understand your feelings.
现
A lot of people have told me this idea,
But there is only one spot,
So I'm in a very tricky situation now! Of course,
I will proceed from the actual situation.
The singer we selected not only performs well usually,
but also must make a name for himself when he goes out,
I know what you're thinking.
You go back and think about it first.
A bit. "
Old Regiment Commander set the "boundary" for handling problems very well.
Isn't it? First, "Your feelings are understandable," then "I'm very busy right now!" and finally, "I know your thoughts,"
"You go back first and think about it." After hearing what the old leader said, Fei Fei
will definitely ask herself:
"This singer not only performs well normally,
but also must become famous when introduced,"
Am I competent enough with my skills? Alas! It's really embarrassing for the old regiment commander.
"Look,"
Wasn't the old regiment commander's problem perfectly solved in silence!
Here's another story:
Once,
The U.S. presidential residence—
—
The White House was undergoing a complete renovation.
The owner of the White House—
—
President Coolidge came to the rooftop for an inspection.
Just then,
an architect and a contractor were there inspecting the beams and rafters.
The architect noticed that the roof truss timber was charred.
This was caused by British troops setting fire to the White House during the War of 1812.
The architect believed that all the rafters had to be replaced.
He sought Coolidge's opinion:
'Should we replace them with wooden structures or the more expensive steel structures?'
Coolidge looked at the charred beams,
and turned to the engineering contractor and said:
"Replace them with steel structures.
As for the bill,
Send it to the King of England,
and have them pay for it.
”
Coolidge, in dealing with this issue,
showed humor containing wisdom:
'"Replacing it with a steel structure" is the definition of the "boundary" of engineering quality:'
"As for the bill,"
Send it to the King of England,
"Let them pay" is the definition of the "boundary" as a politician.

In 1944,
Fascist Germany's defeat was set.
The U.S.,
the Soviet Union,
and the British armies have achieved significant victories on multiple fronts.
In order to study how to deal with a series of legacy issues after the war,
Especially how to deal with defeated Germany,
Soviet Union,
United States,
The leaders of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union decided to hold another summit.
The timing of top-level summits,
the selection and determination of the location and meeting agenda,
has always been an important issue.
At that time,
The physical condition of US President Roosevelt has seriously deteriorated.
Therefore, Roosevelt proposed that
Could the meeting be scheduled for the spring of 1945?
By then, the weather would be warmer.
His body can take it.
The "shrewd and calculating" Stalin had long been aware of Roosevelt's illness.
He knew that
a tired and weary,
A leader who is exhausted will not maintain strong will and stamina during negotiations.
It is impossible to compete with a physically strong opponent.
In Roosevelt's physical condition,
he is easily bored.
268 Mastering Nine Aspects of Analyzing Problems
Weariness,
Anxiety,
Weakness,
thereby easily conceding ground to the opponent.
Stalin then telegraphed Roosevelt:
Due to the rapid development of the situation,
A series of problems urgently need to be resolved.
Therefore, the summit meeting of the top leaders cannot be delayed.
It should be held no later than February 1945.
Helplessly,
Roosevelt had to agree to this date.
He also pointed out that,
he could only travel by boat to the meeting due to health reasons,
which would make the journey take a very long time,
so he hoped the meeting location would not be too far away.
In addition,
it would be best if the meeting location and climate could be warmer,
which would be good for the health.
Stalin refused to go to any place outside of Soviet control,
and insisted that the meeting be held in the Black Sea region.
And specifically proposed holding it in Yalta, a small town on the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea.
Thus,
Stalin could afford to wait at his leisure,
And can keep in touch with Moscow at any time.
Roosevelt had no way to bargain anymore.
He had to drag his sick body,
And brace himself,

In addition, there were a large number of banquets,
cocktail parties,
and evening parties.
All of this exhausted Roosevelt.
In the negotiations,
Roosevelt braced himself,
and bargained with Stalin.
But ultimately, due to physical exhaustion,
Distracted,
Unable to argue with Stalin,
Finally had to hastily end the meeting,
The agreement was signed according to the Soviet Union's intentions.
Chapter 10: Problem analysis can be programmed h 269
Defeat the opponent.
Dear readers,
By now, you should understand,
why Stalin is called "shrewd and calculating." He "calculated" the inherent internal logic of the problem:
Physical weakness—
—
leads to weakness of will—
—
This leads to political weakness.
Handling problems cleverly is always beneficial.
The tactics of winning through wisdom can be broadly categorized into two types:
One type is winning through wisdom by appearing clumsy;
One is the wisdom of insight into the profound.
Whether a problem can be handled "intelligently"
This requires the problem analyst to not only understand the internal logical relationship of the problem,
but also to understand the external connections of the problem.
The smartest people pretend to be confused,
The bravest people pretend to be timid,
Those with great ambitions pretend to be short-sighted,
This is because they have longer-term plans than ordinary people
Higher cultivation.
William Henry Harrison, the ninth President of the United States, was once a child from a poor family.
As a child, he was quiet and shy.
People regarded him as a fool.
He was often teased.
They often threw a 5-cent coin and a 10-cent coin in front of him.
Letting him pick one at random,
Harrison always picked the 5-cent one.
So these people took this as a joke,
and spread it around.
A kind person couldn't stand it any longer,
and said to Harrison:
'"Don't you know that 10 points are worth more than 5 points?" "Of course, I know.'
Harrison gave the kind person a friendly smile,
and said slowly:
"However,
If I pick up that 10-cent coin every time,
I'm afraid they won't be interested in throwing money at me anymore.
Other children thought they
were very clever,
To treat Harrison as
a fool,
not knowing that when they were teasing others, they were actually being
teased by others.
They followed Harrison's intentions,
unconsciously,
willingly,
from their pockets
pulled out the thing Little Harrison needed most—
—
Money.
That's Harrison.
The people who made fun of him hoped he would pick up a nickel to prove he was a fool.
He really did it,
Therefore,
He easily used a false
image to mislead the other party,
To achieve one's own truth in the joy of the other.
Genuine purpose.
Harrison had long seen the external connection of this problem,
Relationship,
That is:
"If I pick up that 10-cent piece every time,
I'm afraid they'll lose interest
in throwing money at me."

Program Three:
Understand the origin of the problem
In daily life,
People often encounter sudden and embarrassing or enraging problems,
and they need to be dealt with immediately.
Otherwise,
it will cause damage to the country,
Career,
Causes a certain impact or loss to the unit or individual.
At this time,
As the analyst of the problem,
Don't worry,
What you need to carefully explore first is:
"Where did this problem come from?"
Once,
Mr. Ma Lianliang, a famous Peking Opera Lao Sheng actor, performed "Tianshui Pass," in which he played Zhuge Liang.
Before the performance,
The actor playing Wei Yan suddenly fell ill.
A colleague who came to visit him volunteered to take his place.
Subbing for the role of Wei Yan.
When the play reached the part where Zhuge Liang set up his command tent, issued orders, and cleverly used a scheme to sow discord,
this actor wanted to play a joke on Ma Lianliang.
this Wei Yan
When it was time to leave the field,
He just wouldn't leave,
But swayed unsteadily, cupping one hand in the other towards Zhuge Liang,
And said in a loud, rough voice:
"This humble general is unaware of the details,"
"I hope the Prime Minister can clearly instruct me!" But,
This sudden situation did not stump Ma Lianliang.
He was slightly startled at first,
Immediately understood the reason for the problem.
Then smiled at "Wei Yan" and,
said:
"This is a military secret,
How can I say it clearly? General Wei, please come over here.
"Wei Yan" had no choice but to walk in front of "Zhuge Liang" upon hearing this.
"Zhuge Liang" only slightly turned his body,
leaning over "Wei
272 Grasp nine aspects of analyzing problems
'"Yan" whispered something in his ear, and then "Wei Yan" repeatedly exclaimed, "Excellent plan, Prime Minister! Excellent plan, Prime Minister!" and then hurried off the stage.'
Even the audience under the stage couldn't understand this improvised "play."
Come.
Actually,
Ma Lianliang's "good idea" was just to lower his voice,
and say with a smile to this colleague:
You
This son of a bitch, hurry up and get out of here!
Ma Lianliang is indeed a great master of art.
Faced with a sudden problem,
He immediately found the reason:
It turned out that a competitor was deliberately testing him.
It wasn't that he messed things up.
So he changed the subject.
Meeting cunning with cunning.
Using skillful words to get out of trouble.
Dealing with problems sometimes brooks no delay,
A decisive decision must be made,
Deal with it promptly,
Not allowing problems the opportunity to "cool down."
This is also a test of wisdom for those handling the problem.
One day,
Premier Zhou set up a real banquet to entertain a diplomatic envoy from Eastern Europe.
A traditional national pattern in a dish was in the shape of the character "卐".
"Unintentionally made into a fascist symbol.
The foreign guests were shocked,
and hurriedly asked the Premier:
""Why is there a fascist symbol in this soup?" The Premier also noticed the "" pattern in the soup,"
He then enthusiastically explained:
"This is not a fascist symbol,
This is a Chinese pattern,
called the 'wan' character,"
Symbolizes 'longevity and happiness'.
"This is a good wish for the guests!" Then,
The Premier humorously said:
"It doesn't matter even if it is a fascist symbol,
Let's all work together to eliminate fascism.
Chapter 10: Problem analysis can be programmed 273
Eat it up!" The guests burst into laughter.
The soup was eaten clean.
Premier Zhou's wit was known throughout the world.
In this story, Premier Zhou immediately realized the origin of the problem:
"It turns out that our traditional national pattern is similar to the Nazi symbol,
which surprised foreign friends."
"Then he quickly used clever and witty language to extricate the other party from the embarrassing situation,"
Showing the elegant demeanor of a proletarian revolutionary.
In addition to this,
The story of Marshal Chen Yi is also remarkably similar.
In the 1960s,
Comrade Chen Yi, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, visited an Asian country.
At a local public gathering,
a religious elder, representing ten thousand monks, presented a Buddha statue to Chen Yi,
Instantly, all eyes were on him.
This famous communist happily accepted the Buddha statue with both hands,
and said loudly:
"With the blessing of the Old Buddha,
"From then on, I am no longer afraid of imperialism," a remark that drew thunderous laughter.
An elder's gift of a Buddha statue represents a kind of etiquette,
one cannot refuse,
but upon receiving the Buddha statue,
Does this also indicate that Communists believe in Buddhism?
This is an issue that needs to be clarified publicly.
Chen Yi immediately realized the origin and importance of this issue.
Chen Yi immediately and cleverly said, "Rely on the blessing of the Old Buddha,
"From now on, we are no longer afraid of imperialism," shaking off the predicament,
Humorous and appropriate.
Hans Christian Andersen lived frugally,
Wearing an old hat and walking in the street,
A rich man mocked him:
"What is that thing on your head? Can that be called a hat?"
Andersen retorted:
"What is that thing under your hat? Can that be called a brain?"
Bag?
Andersen countered the other party with a tit-for-tat approach.
'The approach is to "let the problem come from where it came from'
and then return it to its original place."'

Procedure Four:
Understand the trend of the problem
When a problem suddenly arises,
If you can immediately predict the trend of the problem,
Then you will
quickly find the key to solving the problem.
Xiao Yu, a police officer in a certain city, boarded
a passenger ship bound for a city in the South in order to track down the main culprit of a smuggling group.
When the boat arrived at the Three Gorges,
The passengers came out of the cabins one after another,
To view the strange and beautiful scenery on both sides of the river,
The smugglers also went out.
In order to keep an eye on the criminal's suitcase,
Xiao Yu pretended to be engrossed in a book,
and stayed alone in the cabin.
After a while,
A long-haired girl walked into the cabin,
and saw that Xiao Yu was the only one in the cabin.
She walked up to his bed with a grin.
Suddenly, her face darkened
He ripped open the buttons of his shirt,
and said to Xiao Yu in a low voice:
"Quick, give me your wallet,
or I'll start shouting for help!"
Accusing me of being a hooligan and flirting with you!
Faced with this sudden situation,
Xiao Yu was stunned.
He immediately thought:
If he showed his credentials, he could easily subdue this female criminal.
But doing so would expose his own identity.
The important task of tracking smugglers would be impossible to complete.
If he doesn't expose himself,
The situation in front of me is difficult to deal with again.
After considering the trend of this important issue,
Xiao Yu frowned,
An idea came to mind,
Gesticulating,
Making noises in his mouth,
And writing with a pen:
"I am a fortunate deaf-mute,"
I don't know what you're talking about.
"The woman was stunned for a moment,"
Seeing that there was no one in the room,
She also wrote down her blackmail demands on the paper.
Xiao Yu immediately snatched the note,
and stuffed it into his pocket,
then suddenly stood up and said:
"Get out of here now!
Otherwise, I'll hand the note over to the railway police!\" The female gangster had no choice but to leave reluctantly.
When Xiao Yu was in a dilemma,
he repeatedly considered the trend of the problem,
and then cleverly used the tactic of pretending to be deaf and mute.
Cleverly obtain evidence of the other party's extortion
immediately subdue the opponent,
Achieved the purpose of "solving problems."
There is a similar story in the "Yiwen Leiju" interview,
but it uses irony to reason layer by layer,
thus making it more interesting.
Chapter 10: Analyzing problems can be programmed.
The story tells that Duke Wen of Jin was eating barbecue once.
When it was served,
he actually found a strand of hair wrapped around the outside of the meat
Duke Wen of Jin was furious,
and immediately sent someone to summon the chef who grilled the meat.
The chef took one look
and immediately realized the seriousness of the problem:
Finding a hair on the roasted meat is certainly a great disrespect to Duke Wen of Jin.
The crime of his disrespect deserves the extermination of his nine generations of relatives.
But he really didn't do it himself,
In desperation, he suddenly came up with a good idea.
He quickly knelt down to "confess his sins":
"I am guilty! I deserve to die! I have three sins:
First,
The blade of my knife for slicing meat is as sharp as the precious sword 'Gan Jiang' (a legendary, extremely sharp sword),
The meat is cut,
but
I couldn't cut the hair in the meat;
Secondly,
I skewer the barbecue with an iron awl,
Turning it over and over on the stove,
The meat is roasted to a charred red,
Yet my hair remains unscathed;
Thirdly,
I wore my chef's hat securely and firmly,
Not even sweat could seep out,
Yet it let a strand of hair fall out.
I, your subject, have these three crimes,
I truly deserve to die ten thousand times!
Duke Wen of Jin, after hearing these words,
Suddenly awoke to his senses,
Knowing that the cook was wrongly blamed,
He sent people to investigate,
And indeed, it was found that someone had framed the cook.
Duke Wen of Jin executed the framer,
And rewarded the witty and eloquent cook.
The clever cook, after anticipating the direction of the problem,
first "confessed his guilt," listing his own "three crimes," and repeatedly "pleading guilty."
Intended to stabilize Duke Wen of Jin's emotions.
To ease the atmosphere at the time,
And then, taking advantage of the opportunity to "plead guilty," I analyzed the situation with sarcasm and in a methodical way,
Using irrefutable facts, I deduced that it was completely impossible for me to place the hair,
So that Duke Wen of Jin finally understood the truth,
And the cook escaped death as a result.
And was rewarded.
276 and grasp the nine aspects of analyzing problems
Program Five:
Understand your capabilities for solving this type of problem.
In daily interactions,
there are always things that cause people inconvenience,
or make them unable to bear something
Or the context does not allow direct discussion of certain topics.
It's necessary to conceal the sharpness of one's words,
or smooth out some of the rough edges,
to soften the meaning.
To make it easier for the listener to accept.
The speaker deliberately says something related or similar to their original intention,
To highlight the meaning that was originally intended to be stated directly.
This is a kind of "buffering" ability when dealing with problems.
Many social practices prove that,
Reserving the ability to "buffer" like this,
Is the best "solvent" for solving problems.
A girl finally found a job as a saleswoman in a high-end jewelry store.
One day,
A customer in his thirties came to the store.
He was dressed in shabby clothes,
and he seemed to be in a heavy mood
With an unattainable gaze,
Staring at those high-end jewelry.
Just as the girl was about to take an important call,
Carelessly,
Knocking over a saucer,
Six exquisite diamond rings fell to the ground.
She hurriedly picked up five of them,
But the sixth one was nowhere to be found.
At this time,
She saw the man walking towards the door.
Suddenly,
she realized where the ring was,
the ring was in that man's hand.
But how to get it back? Should I ask him directly? What if he doesn't give it to me? Go to the police? But there's no one else in the store.
Besides,
Even if I could do that,
It would inevitably alarm the boss,
Can she continue her work? What to do? The girl is a smart person.
As the man's hand was about to touch
Chapter 10: Analyzing problems can be programmed
the doorknob,
The girl called out softly:
"Excuse me,
sir!"
The man turned around,
They looked at each other in silence,
For a full minute.
"What is it?" he asked,
the muscles in his face twitching.
" ..."
"The girl didn't speak."
After a moment of silence,
She finally said:
"Sir,"
This is my first job.
You know,
It's not easy to find a job these days.
'"Isn't it?" the girl said with a dim expression.'
The man scrutinized her for a long time,
Finally,
A soft smile appeared on his face.
"Yes,
That's indeed the case.
My situation is even worse than yours.
" he replied,
"But I can be sure,
You won't do well here.
”
He paused,
He took a step forward,
Extending his hand towards the ground:
"May I offer you a blessing?"
The girl immediately reached out her hand as well,
Both hands were clasped tightly together.
She said in a low, but very gentle voice:
"Good luck to you too!"
The girl watched his figure disappear outside the door,
then turned and walked towards the counter,
and put the sixth ring she was holding back in its place.
The girl was indeed facing a difficult problem.
If she called the police,
she would be discovered by her boss and lose her job.
If she insisted on demanding the ring from that person,
Then she is no match for him:
If she asks him to return the ring,
and he, in order to maintain his self-esteem,
face,
May "deny everything after a change of face".
But this girl handled the problem quite well.
Without hurting the other party's feelings,
and without alarming the boss,
And achieved the goal.
This is taken away by the problem-solving "buffer" ability stored by the girl.
This ability includes at least the following two points:
(1) She is very calm.
If she panics,
and starts screaming,
then the effect won't be quite the same.
She needs to be calm.
This is the key ability to deal with all unexpected problems.
(2) The method she used is also very unique,
that is, the ability to adapt flexibly is brought into full play.
The girl impressed the other party by saying it was difficult to find a job.
Because she saw that the other person was also unemployed,
Knowing the difficulties of unemployment,
the other person was moved,
and returned the ring.
So,
whether a pressing problem can be perfectly solved,
is inseparable from the analyst's ability reserves.
Program Six:
Be good at writing an outline of your analysis of the problem.
'"The brave win when enemies meet on a narrow road" is a universally recognized truth.'
This kind of "bravery" carries great risk.
Dealing with problems also requires this kind of courageous and risk-taking spirit,
However,
One must not be reckless in the analysis of problems.
We suggest:
When analyzing and dealing with risky issues,
It might be useful to write an analysis outline first.
During the Southern Song Dynasty,
there was a meritorious and outstanding general famous for fighting against the Jin Dynasty.
This man was brave and topped the three armies.
He was known as "a match for ten thousand men," and in every battle,
he always took the lead,
advancing at the risk of his life.
He was the famous Han Shizhong.
In the third year of Xuanhe (1121),
Song general Li Fu incited soldiers to rebel against the Song court,
and occupied Zizhou (present-day Zibo South, Shandong),
and the Qingzhou area
And had tens of thousands of soldiers.
Deputy Pacification Commissioner Li Mida was unable to quell the rebels,
so he ordered Han Shizhong to lead troops to suppress them.
Han Shizhong had only a thousand men under his command at the time.
To confront Li Fu, who commands tens of thousands of soldiers, is clearly insufficient in strength.
But the mission must still be completed.
This requires courage and wisdom.
When the troops arrived at the Linzi River,
Han Shizhong set up a do-or-die formation,
preparing for a decisive battle with the enemy.
He divided his troops into four teams,
charging fiercely into the enemy camp
Meanwhile,
deploy caltrops behind the troops,
cutting off the retreat,
so that the entire army only has the hope of survival by advancing.
He ordered:
"Advance and you shall win,
Retreat and you shall die;
Retreaters will be killed by the rear guard."
"The soldiers did not hesitate,"
bravely fighting the enemy,
advancing bravely,
before long,
Then break through the enemy lines,
and kill the traitor General Li Fu,
and most of the rebel army was dispersed.
Chapter 10 Analyzing Problems Can Be Programmed 279
The generals and soldiers were shocked by this sudden momentum.
Everyone was scared out of their wits.
They were at a loss.
Some collapsed.
Some knelt and offered wine as a plea for forgiveness,
and all obediently surrendered their armor and weapons.
The next day at dawn,
the enemy troops only saw Han Shizhong alone,
The Song army did not arrive,
Only then did they realize they had been tricked,
but it was too late to resist at this point.
First battle,
Han Shizhong led the entire army, risking being attacked from all sides and even complete annihilation.
He analyzed the grim situation:
Advance and we win,
Retreat and we die
'A fight with one''s back to the river,'
'Destroying the cauldrons and sinking the boats was his operational guideline for the first battle.'
'In the second battle, Han Shizhong went alone,'
'Penetrating an enemy camp of ten thousand soldiers single-handedly,'
Forced the enemy to surrender,
And achieved victory,
Displayed extraordinary courage;
Defeated the enemy with sudden momentum, making them as frightened as birds startled by a bow,
This is the outline of his second battle analysis.
280 Nine aspects of analyzing the problem
Program Seven:
Verify and correct your answer
When dealing with problems, you can't be narrow-minded; you must learn to adapt according to changes in the situation.
Carefully verify the answer.
And on this basis, conduct multi-level.
Multi-angle corrections.
Finally,
To rationalize the solution to the problem,
To perfect it.
In the early 1970s,
The main focus of the struggle gradually shifted from anti-"American imperialism" to anti-"Soviet hegemonism." On February 17, 1973, Mao Zedong proposed the strategy of "one line" when meeting with Kissinger.
On January 5 of the following year,
When meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ohira, he proposed the strategy of 'a large area' again.
"'A line' refers to Japan,"
China,
Pakistan,
Ivory Coast,
Turkey,
Europe,
The United States is on this line.
'"A large area" refers to all countries around this line.'
The countries on "one line" and in "a large area" are united,
To jointly deal with Soviet hegemonism.
This is an important international struggle strategy proposed by Mao Zedong based on new changes in the international situation, especially the changes in the strategic situation between the United States and the Soviet Union and the triangular relationship and interests between China, the United States, and the Soviet Union.
It exploits the deep contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union.
It was based on cautious verification.
It is a revised policy that conforms to the trend of the times.
From the perspective of the strategic situation between the US and the Soviet Union,
After entering the 1970s,
Many important changes have taken place in the comparison of military power between the United States and the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union's core strategic strength caught up with the United States
Also holds an advantage in terms of strategic weapon projection tools;
The Soviet near-shore defense navy has developed into a far-reaching ocean-going navy sufficient to pose a threat to the United States.
The focus of the US-Soviet rivalry was in Europe,
The global strategic focus of the United States is also in Europe,
However, a large part of its military force is in Asia.
Power analysis failure.
The Soviet Union also took advantage of the United States' deep involvement in the Indochina battlefield.
To intensify the struggle in Europe, the Middle East and other regions.
Threatens the main interests of the United States.
Mao Zedong had insight into the international situation,
Believing that the United States had become defensive in the US-Soviet rivalry,
The Soviet Union, however, has become the main threat to the world today.
From the perspective of China policies of the two countries, the Soviet Union and Sudan,
After Brezhnev came to power,
China-Soviet relations became more strained.
In 1969,
The Sino-Soviet conflict erupted in the Zhenbao Island incident and the Xinjiang Tielieketi armed conflict.
The Soviet Union stationed a million troops in the Sino-Soviet border area.
This severely threatened China's security.
It seemed that a major war between China and the Soviet Union was imminent.
At this time, the US government, in order to concentrate its efforts on competing with the Soviet Union in Europe,
需
Chapter 10: Factoring problems can be programmed 281
It is necessary to adjust the strategy,
and implement a retrenchment of forces in Asia.
To this end,
The United States urgently needs to improve its strained relationship with China,
so that it can secure a strategy that prioritizes Europe.
Nixon repeatedly expressed his desire to improve relations with China both during his presidential campaign and after ascending to the presidency.
After the Zhenbao Island incident,
he conveyed a message through Pakistani President Yahya Khan and Romanian President Nicolae Ceaușescu:
Willing to have a dialogue with China.
At the same time, the United States took some actions to ease the tense relations between China and the United States.
In early October 1970,
Nixon told a reporter for the American magazine Time:
"If there's anything I want to do before I die,
it's to go to China.
If I can't go,
I want my children to go.” He openly expressed his desire to come to China.
In the same month,
Nixon was also at a banquet welcoming the Romanian president,
Used the name "People's Republic of China" for the first time as President of the United States.
Mao Zedong possessed keen strategic insight.
He responded to the US's willingness to improve relations.
appropriately.
In October 1970, American journalist Edgar Snow was invited to Tiananmen Square to attend the National Day celebration,
This sent an important signal to the world, especially the United States.
While the US response was slow,
Snow was met again on December 18 of the same year.
Revealed to Snow the intention to welcome Nixon to China.
Mao Zedong said to Snow:
"If Ni
xon is willing to come,"
I am willing to talk with him.
It's fine if we can reach an agreement in the talk.
It's also fine if we can't reach an agreement.
Even arguing is fine.
It's okay not to quarrel,
It's okay to come as a tourist,
It's okay to come as a president,
In short,
Whatever.
"\"I don't think I will quarrel with him,"
Criticism should be given to him.
"\"July 1971,"
Dr. Kissinger, the US National Security Affairs Assistant, secretly visited China.
In February 1972,
US President Nixon visited China,
China and the United States signed the "Joint Communiqué" (i.e., the famous "Shanghai Communiqué") in Shanghai.
Although there is still some time before the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States,
282 Grasping Nine Aspects of Problem Analysis
the tense relationship has been greatly eased.
With the Soviet threat intensifying and American power shrinking,
At that time, in order to avoid fighting on two fronts,
To counter the threat of Soviet hegemony, which was the most dangerous at the time,
Mao Zedong's "one line" of allying with the United States to contain the Soviet Union,
and the strategy of "one big area" came into being.
The implementation of Mao Zedong's strategy
ended the state of hostility between China and the United States that lasted for more than 20 years,
placed China in an active position in the "Great Triangle" relationship,
and improved the national security situation,
Enhanced international standing,
Led to the formation of a new international strategic landscape,
And also laid the foundation for the future development of Sino-US relations.
During this period,
China regained its legitimate seat in the United Nations;
It almost improved relations with all Western countries;
Relations with Third World countries have also greatly developed.
Historically, the entire 1970s is known as a period of great strides in China's diplomacy.
This is inseparable from Mao Zedong's wisdom in controlling the situation and dealing with problems from a commanding height.
It is even more inseparable from Mao Zedong's presence in the ever-changing international landscape.
It is inseparable from the constantly changing and revised thinking.

Take full advantage of opportunities to communicate with people,
Make sure those critical pieces of information are fully heard by people.
Make sure they fully understand your original intention.
Do not rely on speculation,
