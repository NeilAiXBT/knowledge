### Analogy and Examples for Each Dimension

1. **Utilization Rate**: Like measuring how many hours a car is driven versus the hours it is parked. If a car is available for 10 hours but driven only 7, the utilization rate is 70%.
2. **Resource Availability**: Picture a sports team—availability is which players are fit and ready to play any given match.
3. **Resource Capacity**: Like the number of guests a hotel can accommodate at full occupancy.
4. **Allocation Accuracy**: Imagine assigning a chef to make sushi; if the assigned chef specializes in French cuisine, allocation accuracy is low.
5. **Skill Alignment**: Assigning a master pastry chef to desserts and not to grills ensures best results.
6. **Cost of Utilization**: Cost per mile to run a delivery truck—tracking gas, maintenance, and labor.
7. **Utilization Variance**: If you scheduled 10 hours of cleaning crew work but only 7 happened, variance is -3 hours.
8. **Resource Conflict Rate**: Like two meetings booked in the same conference room at the same time.
9. **Productivity Rate**: How many pizzas a chef can bake per hour.
10. **Risk of Harm/Impact**: Using tired staff to operate heavy machinery increases risk—this risk needs assessment.
