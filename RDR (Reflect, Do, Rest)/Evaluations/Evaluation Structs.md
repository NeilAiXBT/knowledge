### Classification of Evaluation Structs: MECE Compliance

The “Evaluation Structs” are categorized based on their roles, ensuring each type is **mutually exclusive** and collectively exhaustive (**MECE**):

1. **Contextual Influence Structs:**  
   Consist of Factors, representing conditions/variables affecting the program but not being direct structural parts.

2. **Analytical Perspective Structs:**  
   Consist of Aspects, denoting the unique lenses or standpoints from which an evaluation is conducted.

3. **Structural Constituent Structs:**  
   Comprise Components (modules or parts) and Elements (specific indicators or units within components).

4. **Measurement Scale Structs:**  
   Dimensions, referring to the axes/scales along which data are measured and interpreted.

This structure avoids overlap and covers all possible evaluation constituents.

---

### Analogies and Real-World Examples

1. **Factors (Contextual Influence)**:  
   _Analogy:_ Like “weather” affecting a sporting event—impactful but uncontrollable.  
   _Example:_ A community health intervention is influenced by local economic downturn or political changes.

2. **Aspects (Analytical Perspective):**  
   _Analogy:_ Different camera angles revealing various views of a scene.  
   _Example:_ Evaluating an education program through teacher, student, and policy-maker perspectives.

3. **Components (Structural Constituent):**  
   _Analogy:_ Rooms in a house, each with unique functions building up the structure.  
   _Example:_ Program modules: curriculum, counseling, outreach.

4. **Elements (Structural Constituent):**  
   _Analogy:_ Bricks that form the rooms; small, measurable units building larger structures.  
   _Example:_ Number of sessions completed equals tracked elements.

5. **Dimensions (Measurement Scale):**  
   _Analogy:_ Rulers or axes (length, width, height) that measure the quality or extent.  
   _Example:_ Implementation fidelity on a 1–5 scale.
