### 1. Identification and MECE Classification of Evaluation Methods

**Evaluation methods** can be cleanly grouped into three primary MECE categories:  
1. **Qualitative Evaluation**  
2. **Quantitative Evaluation**  
3. **Mixed-Methods Evaluation** 

Where appropriate, there are focused subtypes such as Process, Outcome, Impact, and Economic (Cost-Benefit/Effectiveness) that align with workflow stages and decision types. These subtypes are not mutually exclusive “methods” per se but designate the evaluation’s temporal or functional focus.

---

### 2. Definitions, Functions, and Key Characteristics

#### 1. Qualitative Evaluation

**Definition**:  
A methodology focused on non-numerical, descriptive data—capturing meaning, feelings, and context from subjects or stakeholders.

**Function**:  
Explains "why" and "how" phenomena occur, uncovering motivations and processes.

**Characteristics**:  
- Subjective and flexible
- Rich, narrative detail
- Emergent structure (questions & findings evolve)
- Context-dependent (cannot fully generalize)
- Common techniques: in-depth interviews, focus groups, open-ended observations.

**Analogy**:  
Like a documentary film, it reveals underlying stories, emotions, and processes not visible in quantitative reports.

**Example**:  
A hospital uses focus groups with patients to understand why certain services are perceived as lacking.

#### 2. Quantitative Evaluation

**Definition**:  
A methodology relying on collection and analysis of numerical data to measure impacts, test hypotheses, and generalize findings.

**Function**:  
Determines “what”, “how many”, “to what extent”—usually post-intervention.

**Characteristics**:  
- Objective, structured, replicable  
- Relies on instruments like surveys, tests  
- Uses statistical and mathematical modeling  
- Supports broad generalization

**Analogy**:  
Measuring a building’s height with a tape measure: precise, comparative, and scalable.

**Example**:  
A randomized controlled trial measuring how many patients recover with a new drug.

#### 3. Mixed-Methods Evaluation

**Definition**:  
An integrative approach using both qualitative and quantitative techniques for comprehensive understanding and triangulation.

**Function**:  
Bridges numerical breadth and contextual depth, balancing rigor and richness.

**Characteristics**:  
- Combines strengths of both mono-methods
- Complex, often more costly 
- Flexible in sequence (concurrent or sequential)

**Analogy**:  
Mixing coffee and milk to create a latte—the integrative product is richer than either alone.

**Example**:  
A public health program uses surveys for population trends and interviews to understand user barriers.

#### 4. Process Evaluation

**Definition**:  
Assesses whether a program was delivered as planned, focusing on fidelity, delivery, and operational issues.

**Function & Characteristics**:  
- Monitors ongoing implementation  
- Useful for real-time adaptation  
- Often uses qualitative (observations, logs) + some basic quantitative metrics

**Analogy**:  
Quality control in an assembly line—catching errors before final production.

**Example**:  
Observation sheets for classroom rollouts of a new curriculum.

#### 5. Outcome Evaluation

**Definition**:  
Measures direct, residual results of an intervention—usually at a program’s end or at specific milestones.

**Function & Characteristics**:  
- Focuses on immediate effects (e.g., knowledge gained)
- Uses pre/post tests or indicator tracking  
- Often quantitative, but can include stakeholder narratives

**Analogy**:  
Final exam at the end of a course.

**Example**:  
Testing knowledge after a series of training workshops.

#### 6. Impact Evaluation

**Definition**:  
Assesses causal, longer-term effects of interventions—beyond immediate outcomes.

**Function & Characteristics**:  
- Tests for attribution, e.g., did Project X cause social change Y?
- Relies on robust techniques (RCTs, cohort tracking, matched controls, regression models)

**Analogy**:  
Studying how decades of warming influence climate patterns.

**Example**:  
Evaluating whether a national education reform has improved adult literacy after 10 years.

#### 7. Economic Evaluation (Cost-Benefit / Cost-Effectiveness)

**Definition**:  
Examines financial costs versus program benefits (monetized or pragmatic outcome units).

**Function & Characteristics**:  
- Used for resource allocation, scaling, or policy decisions 
- Can be appended to any phase (preferably in summative/impact stages)
- Involves modeling, simulated alternatives, and scenario analysis

**Analogy**:  
Choosing the best grocery deal by weighing price against nutritional value.

**Example**:  
Deciding which mental health intervention to fund based on cost per improved patient outcome.

---

### 3. Purposes, Techniques, and Technical Selection Reasons

**Qualitative**:  
Purpose—explore phenomena for which context and nuance matter or are unknown.  
Techniques—semi-structured interviews, focus groups, participant observations.  
Selection—chosen when little is known, when you need narratives, or where numbers can't capture complexity (e.g., stigma, emotional change).

**Quantitative**:  
Purpose—measure, test, generalize, confirm.  
Techniques—surveys, structured tests, experiments, statistical modeling.  
Selection—when objective measurement is needed, for comparing groups or proving causality.

**Mixed-Methods**:  
Purpose—comprehensive portrayal, fairness to both context and outcomes, triangulation.  
Techniques—combining survey + interviews; concurrent or sequential designs.  
Selection—when you need both "what" and "why", or to confirm and explain impacts together.

**Process**:  
Purpose—delivery/fidelity, procedural troubleshooting.  
Techniques—checklists, logbooks, real-time feedback.  
Selection—critical when scale, time, or variation in implementation is likely.

**Outcome/Impact**:  
Purpose—proof of effectiveness/causality.  
Techniques—benchmark testing, longitudinal tracking, RCTs.  
Selection—regulatory or donor accountability and large-scale adoption decisions.

**Economic**:  
Purpose—resource optimization, cost management.  
Techniques—cost-benefit matrices, cost per outcome unit, ROI calculations.  
Selection—when budget is a constraint or value-for-money must be demonstrated.

---

### 4. Phase-Based Workflow Integration

- **Design & Development**:  
  - **Qualitative methods** are vital in formative evaluation to shape strategies, guide needs analysis, and understand risks.
- **Implementation**:  
  - **Process evaluations** ensure delivery per protocol; mixed-methods may flag real-time issues.
- **Completion/Summative**:  
  - **Quantitative and outcome/impact evaluations** measure final goals achieved.
- **Sustainability/Replication**:  
  - **Impact and economic evaluations** support resource decisions and external communications.
