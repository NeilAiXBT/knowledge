### Introduction to System Evaluation Dimensions and MECE Compliance

System evaluation dimensions constitute a foundational framework to comprehensively assess the performance, quality, and impact of a system across its lifecycle. To avoid gaps and overlaps, MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) compliance is critical: each dimension must represent distinct, non-overlapping aspects while the complete set must span the entire evaluation space. This ensures clarity, systematic analysis, and actionable outcomes.

### Logical Classification and Organization of Dimensions

The systematic classification of evaluation dimensions follows a structure validated by widely accepted frameworks such as the DeLone and McLean Information Systems Success Model and refined through subsequent research:

1. **System Quality**
2. **Information Quality**
3. **Service Quality**
4. **Use/Usage**
5. **User Satisfaction**
6. **Net Benefits (Outcomes/Impact)**

These six dimensions jointly cover technical, informational, service, behavioral, perceptual, and resultant facets with clear boundaries, achieving robust MECE compliance.

### Analogy and Illustrative Examples (Numbered List)

To clarify each dimension, consider the analogy of evaluating an automobile:

1. **System Quality:** Like the car’s engine and chassis reliability—smooth starting, responsive acceleration, and minimal breakdowns.
   - *Example:* An online learning platform runs without crashes, loads quickly, and offers an intuitive dashboard.

2. **Information Quality:** Comparable to the accuracy and relevance of dashboard instruments such as speedometers and fuel gauges.
   - *Example:* A medical record system provides precise, complete, and up-to-date patient details.

3. **Service Quality:** Parallels customer service at a dealership—prompt maintenance, courteous support, and efficient repairs.
   - *Example:* IT helpdesk efficiently resolves user issues and upgrades the system proactively.

4. **Use/Usage:** Reflects how frequently and for what tasks the car is driven.
   - *Example:* Employees use a corporate intranet daily for document retrieval and collaboration.

5. **User Satisfaction:** Gauges how content the owner is with driving and owning the car.
   - *Example:* Users rate an e-commerce portal highly for ease-of-use and satisfaction with their shopping experience.

6. **Net Benefits:** Represents gain in convenience, reduced commute time, or fuel savings due to the car.
   - *Example:* An HR system streamlines recruitment, saving time and operational costs.

### Core Elements, Components, and Factors

Each dimension comprises specific elements:

- **System Quality:** Reliability, scalability, usability, performance, security.
- **Information Quality:** Accuracy, relevance, timeliness, completeness.
- **Service Quality:** Responsiveness, empathy, support availability.
- **Usage:** Access frequency, breadth of use, integration into workflows.
- **User Satisfaction:** Perceived value, positive attitudes, subjective ratings.
- **Net Benefits:** Operational efficiency, strategic impact, cost savings, productivity.

### Listing Core Evaluation Dimensions and Corresponding Evaluation Criteria

1. **System Quality:** Reliability metrics, uptime %, error frequency, response times.
2. **Information Quality:** Data accuracy rates, completeness indices, timeliness scores.
