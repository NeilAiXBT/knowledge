### Classification and MECE Structure of Self-Discipline Performance Dimensions

Self-discipline performance dimensions are organized to comply with the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principle, ensuring no overlap among categories and comprehensive coverage of the construct. The three primary, widely-accepted dimensions are:

1. **Behavioral Control**: Regulates physical actions and habits, encompassing delay of gratification, impulsive behavior management, and adherence to routines.
2. **Cognitive (Thinking) Control**: Concerns regulatory processes over thought patterns, including decision-making, planning, prioritization, and goal-setting.
3. **Emotional Control**: Involves managing emotional responses, maintaining motivation, and building resilience in stressful or challenging situations.

Additional paradigms for specific applied contexts—such as "responsibility," "honesty," "compliance with regulations," and "patience/determination/intention"—are derived from educational frameworks assessing citizenship and social behavior. These sub-dimensions ensure finer-grained evaluation based on context.

### Analogy and Real-World Examples

Self-discipline can be analogized to a spacecraft’s control center:
- **Behavioral Thrusters** (Behavioral Control): Adjusts immediate actions for trajectory correction.
- **Navigation System** (Cognitive Control): Plans the trip, recognizes waypoints, and updates routes as necessary.
- **Stabilizer Systems** (Emotional Control): Responds to turbulence, keeping the spacecraft steady during unexpected conditions.

**Examples**:
1. **Behavioral Control**: A student resists the urge to scroll social media, choosing to finish homework first.
2. **Cognitive Control**: An employee constructs a detailed weekly agenda, assesses priorities, and adapts to unexpected work tasks.
3. **Emotional Control**: An athlete remains focused and committed despite losing a competition, using the setback as motivation for future training.

### Core Elements, Components, Factors, and Aspects

1. **Behavioral Control**
   - Elements: Delay of gratification, impulse regulation, positive habit enforcement.
   - Components: Not procrastinating on tasks, resisting distractions, sustaining routines.
   - Factors: Willpower, ability to strengthen oneself, positive self-imposition.

2. **Cognitive Control**
   - Elements: Decision-making, planning, goal-setting, monitoring.
   - Components: Flexibility in strategy, effective prioritization, cognitive adjustment.
   - Factors: Self-regulation, strategic thinking, metacognition.

3. **Emotional Control**
   - Elements: Emotional regulation, stress management, motivation maintenance.
   - Components: Coping mechanisms, perseverance, responsible emotional expression.
   - Factors: Emotional intelligence, resilience.

### Core Evaluation Dimensions & Criteria
