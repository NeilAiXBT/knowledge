### Comprehensive Segmentation of All Periods in a Day: MECE-Compliant Classification

A standard, MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) classification of periods in a 24-hour day divides time into contiguous, non-overlapping segments that together cover all hours, ensuring each time instance belongs to only one category and none are omitted or duplicated. Here is a logically structured classification with typical time blocks:

1. **Late Night:** 00:00–04:00  
   - Deepest hours of the night, minimum natural and human activity.

2. **Early Morning:** 04:00–06:00  
   - Transition from night to dawn, marks the initial light and awakening phase.

3. **Morning:** 06:00–12:00  
   - Period of increasing daylight, commonly used for the start of active routines and work.

4. **Afternoon:** 12:00–17:00  
   - After midday; continued activity, sunlight beginning to wane.

5. **Evening:** 17:00–20:00  
   - Sunset transition, daylight receding, winding down activities.

6. **Night:** 20:00–24:00  
   - Onset of darkness, rest, and sleep for most.

Each period is precisely delimited to avoid overlap and ensure full coverage of the 24-hour cycle.  

---

### Analogies and Illustrative Examples

- **Analogy to a Clock Face:** Visualize the day like a clock face divided into colored bands. Each color represents a distinct period, ensuring there’s never overlap and no portion of the day is unassigned—a system similar to a pie chart with fixed, labeled slices.
- **Example of Natural Events:**  
  - **Late Night:** Like a quiet dormant garden before sunrise.  
  - **Early Morning:** Like dew forming as light gradually returns.  
  - **Morning:** Comparable to a worker at the peak of activity.  
  - **Afternoon:** Resembles a runner sustaining hope towards the end of the race.  
  - **Evening:** The sunset is akin to dimming the lights in a theater as the main event concludes.  
  - **Night:** Like closing chapters of a book; darkness falls and rest ensues.

---

### Core Elements, Components, Factors, and Aspects

- **Environmental:** Intensity and presence of natural light, temperature variation.
- **Human Activity:** Work/rest schedules, biological rhythms (circadian).
- **Social Customs:** Cultural and occupational norms assigned to each period.
