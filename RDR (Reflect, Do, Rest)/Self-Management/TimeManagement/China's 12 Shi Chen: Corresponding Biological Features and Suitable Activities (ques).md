### Overview of China's 12 Shi Chen: Corresponding Biological Features and Suitable Activities

China’s 12 Shi Chen system divides the 24-hour day into twelve equal, non-overlapping (MECE-compliant) time intervals of two hours each, with each period named and associated with fluctuations in biological functions and optimal activities. This framework has been central in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and aligns well with modern insights into human chronobiology.
