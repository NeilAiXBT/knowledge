### Introduction and MECE Classification of Daily Life Management

Daily life management is a broad construct that encompasses the diverse activities and systems individuals use to organize, regulate, and optimize their everyday existence. A well-structured classification of these management types should satisfy the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principle, ensuring that the categories do not overlap and together fully represent the spectrum of daily life management.

**Main Types of Daily Life Management (MECE Principle):**

1. Self-Management
2. Task and Activity Management
3. Health and Wellness Management
4. Resource and Household Management
5. Social and Relationship Management
6. Information and Knowledge Management
7. Environmental and External Interaction Management

Each category is distinct yet collectively covers all facets of managing daily living.
