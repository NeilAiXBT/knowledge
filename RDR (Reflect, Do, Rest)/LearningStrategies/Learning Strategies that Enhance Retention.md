#### 1.2 Functions and Characteristics
- **Function:** Enhance the encoding and retrieval of information.
- **Characteristics:** Employ tools like active recall (e.g., testing oneself), elaborative rehearsal (connecting new with known), visualization, and story-building.

#### 1.3 Analogy and Example
- **Analogy:** Like exercising a muscle repeatedly, frequent retrieval practice strengthens memory.
- **Example:** Using flashcards to memorize vocabulary; answering practice questions after every chapter.

#### 1.4 Core Elements and Workflow
- **Elements:** Encoding, consolidation, retrieval.
- **Workflow:** 
  1. Initial encoding using elaboration/mnemonics.
  2. Periodic retrieval, with feedback, to reinforce memory traces.
  3. Integration with other material for deeper application.

#### 1.5 Core Evaluation Dimensions
- **Effectiveness:** Measured via pre/post testing and delayed recall.
- **Engagement:** Frequency and depth of cognitive strategy use.

#### 1.6 Purpose and Assumptions
- **Value:** Deeper processing leads to stronger retention.
- **Descriptive:** Regular recall combats forgetting.
