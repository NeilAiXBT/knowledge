### Conceptualization

1. **Definition of Core Idea**
   - The process of conceptualization begins by identifying the precise main idea: expecting a 30% salary increase when shifting jobs is a quantifiable anticipation regarding compensation change directly triggered by a job transition.
   - *Example*: Understanding that the "30%" indicates a specific, measurable change rather than a vague desire.

2. **Boundary and Scope Setting**
   - This expectation is defined with clear limits: it focuses only on base salary change due to a job switch, excluding bonuses, stock options, or other non-salary perks.
   - *Example*: Excluding health benefits or paid leave enhancements from this expectation.

3. **Contextual Relevance**
   - The context encompasses labor market conditions, personal career paths, and negotiation practices.
   - *Example*: Recognizing economic trends or standard corporate policies affecting salary jumps.

### Conceptual Mapping

1. **Actor and Outcome**
   - The employee is the actor, the outcome is a 30% higher base salary via job change.
   - *Example*: An engineer moving to a competitor for a larger paycheck.

2. **Causal Relationships**
   - Mapping highlights causal logic: job change → negotiation opportunity → increased compensation.
   - *Example*: The act of leaving one company creates grounds to request significantly higher pay.

3. **External Market Milestones**
   - Concepts are related by linking the 30% expectancy to known market averages and periodic salary reviews.
   - *Example*: Correlating a 30% personal target to a 10-20% industry norm.

### Abstract Ideas

1. **Value and Reward for Advancement**
   - The expectation implies that progressing to a new job should equate to a tangible reward—a higher valuation of labor.
   - *Example*: Believing an upward career move ought to be paired with substantial pay growth.

2. **Negotiation and Leverage as Abstract Constructs**
   - Job change offers abstract bargaining power, giving the employee a stronger position to demand higher pay.
   - *Example*: Viewing salary negotiation as an exercise of analytical and persuasive skill.

3. **Market Calibration of Professional Worth**
   - The anticipated figure (30%) symbolically reflects the job market’s method of “pricing” talent.
   - *Example*: Treating compensation increases as validation of rising skill demand.

### General Understanding

1. **Prevailing Salary Increase Norms**
   - It’s widely understood that job changers typically receive higher increases than stayers, but 30% is generally above average.
   - *Example*: Most new job offers yield 10–20% increases, making a 30% target ambitious.

2. **Rationale for Larger Raises During Job Changes**
   - Changing companies is commonly recognized as the most effective means for a sizable pay hike.
   - *Example*: Employees expect larger increments from switching jobs than from yearly reviews.

3. **Risk-Reward Calculation**
   - Anticipating a 30% increase is also seen as compensation for the uncertainties and challenges that come with moving roles.
   - *Example*: Demanding a premium for the effort and risk involved in the transition.

### Generalization

1. **Typical Market Generalization**
   - Job changes are generally associated with notable salary increases.
   - *Example*: The assumption that moving jobs “should” bring at least a double-digit percentage raise.

2. **Inflated Expectations as Ambition or Strategy**
   - Generalizing, a 30% increase may reflect strategic over-asking or an ambitious sense of self-worth.
   - *Example*: A candidate aiming high to allow haggling room in negotiations.

3. **Sector-Dependent Generalizations**
   - The general feasibility of such increases varies by industry, sector, and geography.
   - *Example*: Believing a 30% hike is realistic in tech but improbable in education.

### Classification and Grouping

1. **Salary Increase Magnitude Groups**
   - Increases can be classified as standard (<10%), moderate (10–20%), high (20–30%), or exceptional (>30%).
   - *Example*: Placing a 30% expectation in the “high” category.

2. **Trigger Events for Expectation**
   - Grouping by cause: external moves (e.g., job change) vs internal moves (e.g., promotion).
   - *Example*: A 3-5% annual raise for staying; 30% for external job hopping.

3. **Motivations Behind Expectation**
   - Categories: market adjustment, undervaluation, career advancement.
   - *Example*: Expecting a big bump because the current employer pays below market.

### Pattern Recognition

1. **Empirical Averages**
   - Pattern: Most job changers secure 10–20% raises, with 30% being rare.
   - *Example*: Data showing an average of 14.8% in recent statistics.

2. **Gap Between Expectation and Market Reality**
   - There’s a frequent mismatch between what employees expect (e.g., 30%) and what is commonly achieved.
   - *Example*: Candidates routinely seeking more than market-supported increases.

3. **Motivational Patterns**
   - Employees tend to set higher expectations as motivation for transition.
   - *Example*: Setting a 30% threshold as a personal standard for accepting offers.

### Hypothetical Reasoning

1. **Scenario: Expectation Realized**
   - The job seeker lands a 30% raise through a strategic job move.
   - *Example*: Accepts a new role with both better pay and enhanced job satisfaction.

2. **Scenario: Expectation Modifies Offer**
   - The expectation incites negotiation, resulting in a compromise (e.g., 20% raise).
   - *Example*: Candidate asks for 30%, employer offers 15%, they agree at 20%.

3. **Scenario: Expectation Not Realized**
   - The candidate fails to secure a sufficiently higher offer, prompting continued search or reconsideration.
   - *Example*: No offers meet the 30% bar, leading to job market re-entry.

### Symbolic and Metaphorical Reasoning

1. **Metaphor: Career Ladder**
   - The 30% raise symbolizes climbing several rungs on the professional ladder.
   - *Example*: Each rung signifies tangible advancement; a 30% raise is a major step.

2. **Symbol: Tree Growth Ring**
   - Each salary jump is a new ring signifying measurable, substantive progress.
   - *Example*: The new job “grows” the career with a visible, significant increment.

3. **Metaphor: Crossing a Bridge**
   - The salary increase represents journeying to a new “land” of opportunity and reward.
   - *Example*: The bridge traversed by a job change leads to richer compensation “territory.”

### Flexibility and Perspective-Taking

1. **Employee Perspective**
   - The job changer deems 30% a fair jump, basing it on personal value and market research.
   - *Example*: Analyzing past job moves and market rates justifies aiming high.

2. **Employer Perspective**
   - The hiring firm may see 30% as above budget, prompting negotiation.
   - *Example*: Employers may cap increases at 20% unless skill scarcity demands more.

3. **Market/Industry Perspective**
   - Certain roles or regions justify higher raises, while others do not.
   - *Example*: Tech sector applicants can sometimes achieve or exceed 30%, others cannot.

4. **Compensation Package Perspective**
   - Candidates weigh total compensation (benefits, PTO) relative to base increases.
   - *Example*: Accepting slightly worse benefits for a much better salary.
