### Introduction to Core Verbs and Their Relationships with ‘Books’

Core verbs represent essential, high-frequency actions and concepts that are foundational to communication regardless of context, and they hold particular value in relation to books due to their broad applicability and flexibility. Understanding how these verbs interact with books is vital not just for language learning and literacy development but also for supporting communication for diverse learners using AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) systems. For clarity and systematic understanding, these core verbs and their associations have been analyzed, classified, and visualized in accordance with MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principles.

### Classification of Relationships: Semantic Categories

The relationship between core verbs and books falls into four mutually exclusive categories, ensuring each verb belongs only to one category, and together they cover all major types of book interactions:

1. **Physical Interaction Verbs:** Actions involving direct manipulation of the book or its parts.
2. **Perception and Cognition Verbs:** Activities focused on sensory recognition and mental processing relating to books.
3. **Engagement and Emotional Response Verbs:** Emotional or motivational reactions and user’s subjective experience linked to books.
4. **Communication and Expression Verbs:** Sharing, describing, or expressing ideas, knowledge, or content from books.

Each category is designed according to the meaning of the verbs, not the directionality of action, so there is no semantic overlap and no omission of key relationship types.

### 1. Physical Interaction Verbs

Physical interaction refers to tactile or mechanical actions performed on books or their elements, forming the basis of book handling.

| Verb       | Relationship Symbol | Feedback | Explanation                                                                            |
|------------|--------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| open       | →                  | +        | Opening a book to access its contents initiates the reading process.       |
| close      | ←                  | +        | Closing a book signals the completion or interruption of engagement.             |
| turn       | →                  | +        | Turning pages enables navigation and progression through the book.       |
| put        | →                  | +        | Putting a book refers to placing or arranging it, often for storage or organization.|

These verbs consistently foster positive engagement, as each is associated with constructive interaction or organization.

### 2. Perception and Cognition Verbs

This category involves the sensory recognition of books and all mental processes used to understand, locate, or interact with book content.

| Verb   | Relationship Symbol | Feedback | Explanation                                                                            |
|--------|--------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| see    | ↔                  | ±        | To see a book is to visually recognize its physical presence or content.  |
| look   | →                  | +        | Actively observing a book, such as focusing on its cover, illustrations, or content.|
| find   | →                  | +        | Searching for and locating a book within a space or a collection.                 |
| know   | ±                  | ±        | Gaining knowledge from or about a book, which may be neutral or evoke other feelings.|

Here, seeing and looking denote different intensity and intent; ‘see’ is passive or circumstantial, while ‘look’ is deliberate. These verbs lead to both positive and neutral outcomes, depending on the cognitive or emotional context.

---

### 3. Engagement and Emotional Response Verbs

Engagement and emotion relate to internal reactions, affective states, and the desire to interact with or through books.

| Verb  | Relationship Symbol | Feedback | Explanation                                                                              |
|-------|--------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| like  | →                  | +        | Expressing a positive feeling or preference for a book or its content.      |
| want  | →                  | +        | Demonstrating a desire for a book or the wish to interact with it.          |
| feel  | →                  | ±        | Experiencing emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness) in response to a book.     |
| help  | →, user/book       | +        | Receiving or giving assistance during reading or comprehension, as books can support the user (or vice versa).|

The response ‘feel’ is context-dependent, so it can be either positive or negative. The other verbs generally elicit positive feedback connected to motivation and positive affect.

---

### 4. Communication and Expression Verbs

Communication and expression are about sharing, discussing, or articulating book content, opinions, or resulting ideas.

| Verb  | Relationship Symbol | Feedback | Explanation                                                                                |
|-------|--------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| say   | →                  | +        | Verbalizing words or passages from the book, such as reading aloud or quoting.      |
| talk  | →                  | +        | Discussing book content, story, or related ideas in social or educational settings.  |
| write | ←                  | +        | Producing text influenced by or referencing the book (e.g., reviews, notes).         |
| tell  | →                  | +        | Narrating or explaining stories or facts based on book content.                      |

These verbs facilitate information sharing, social learning, and creative output, resulting in positive communicative feedback.

| Relationship Type           | Core Verbs                                  | Explanation/Symbol         | Feedback Type |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| Physical Interaction       | open → book, close ← book, turn → page, put → book | Direct actions on the book (+ initiation, movement, or placement) | +            |
| Perception & Cognition     | see ↔ book, look → book, find → book, know ± book  | Sensory and mental processing (± recognition, observation, knowledge) | ±           |
| Engagement & Emotional     | like → book, want → book, feel → book, help → book/user | Feelings, desire, and supportive interaction [emotional engagement] | + / ±        |
| Communication & Expression | say → words from book, talk → about book, write ← book, tell → about book | Expressing, sharing, or generating content (communication) | +            |

---

### MECE Principle Verification

**Mutual Exclusivity:**  
Each verb is uniquely classified in only one semantic category. For example, ‘open’ appears solely under Physical Interaction, while ‘see’ and ‘look’ are both under Perception & Cognition but represent distinct modes of interaction (passive versus active viewing), and no verb is repeated across classifications.

**Collective Exhaustiveness:**  
No meaningful relationship verb used in core book communication is omitted. The categories collectively cover all conceivable ways individuals engage with, process, and communicate about books in everyday contexts spanning handling, recognizing, feeling, and narrating.

---

### Further Illustrative Examples

- “Open the book” (Physical) begins the interactive process.
- “Look at the pictures” (Perceptual) draws attention to visual content.
- “I like this story” (Emotional/Engagement) expresses preference.
- “Let me tell you about this chapter” (Communication) conveys narrative sharing.
- “Can you help me read?” (Support) shows assistance relationship.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the identified core verbs and their classified relationships with ‘Books’ are semantically exclusive, collectively exhaustive, and visually and verbally clarified using relational symbols and feedback types. This systematic framework enables efficient communication, instruction, and learning across a wide range of settings, especially where foundational language and interaction with books are prioritized. The accompanying mapping diagram and summary table provide a concise, visual reference for understanding and applying these key concepts in real-world contexts.
