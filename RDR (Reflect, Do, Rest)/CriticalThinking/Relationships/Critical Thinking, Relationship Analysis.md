### Classification of Core Verbs and Relationship Types (MECE-Checked)

To comprehensively and uniquely describe the key relationships between 'Critical Thinking' and 'Relationship Analysis,' the verbs below are classified using Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) categories based strictly on their meanings. Each function is accompanied by directions (→, ←, ↔) and feedback types +(positive), -(negative), or ±(both) for clarity. This structure avoids overlap and ensures all major functions are represented without omission or redundancy.

#### 1. Analyze & Interpret  
**Verbs focusing on dissection, organization, and meaning-making.**

```

**Explanation:**  
- The diagram centers on Critical Thinking as the initiating node.
- Three distinct, meaning-based branches (MECE: Analyze & Interpret, Infer & Evaluate, Communicate & Connect) represent the core classes of critical thinking functions.
- Each branch contains unique verbs, each with prescribed directionality and feedback type.
- Relationship Analysis is represented as the field into which Critical Thinking deploys all its key functions, mediated by the processes above.
- Bidirectional (↔) verbs clarify mutual relationship influence (especially in communication and collaboration).

#### Notes on MECE Structure

- **Mutual Exclusivity:** Each verb belongs only to one meaning-based category, avoiding functional overlap.
- **Collective Exhaustiveness:** The three categories and associated verbs cover the full range of analytical, judgement, and communicative actions linking critical thinking to relationship analysis.
- **Clear Relationship Symbols:** All verbs are assigned directional symbols to depict flow/interdependence.
- **Feedback Representation:** All verbs are also designated +, -, or ± depending on whether they reinforce, challenge, or neutrally/complexly interact with relationships.

This structured approach ensures that each functional dimension between Critical Thinking and Relationship Analysis is distinctly and completely represented, enabling concise demonstration and application in academic, personal, or professional domains.
