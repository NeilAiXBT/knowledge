### Core Verbs and Classification According to Relationship Meaning

To clarify the key relationships between 'Performance' and 'Security,' the core verbs are structured into three mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) categories: **Trade-off Verbs**, **Influence Verbs**, and **Balance Verbs**. Each category encapsulates a distinct relationship meaning, and all relevant directions and feedback types are encoded as required.

#### 1. Trade-off Verbs (Negative Feedback, -)

These verbs describe inherently conflicting or compensatory relationships, where improvement in one aspect typically results in degradation in the other.

- **Impact**: Highlights that enhancements or constraints in security can impact performance and vice versa, often increasing overhead or introducing latency.  
  **Relationship Symbol(s):** ↔  
  **Feedback Type:** –  
- **Affect**: Refers to direct influence; for instance, security requirements often affect performance by imposing restrictions or checks.  
  **Relationship Symbol(s):** ↔  
  **Feedback Type:** –  
- **Degrade**: Indicates that extra security processes can degrade system performance by consuming additional resources or increasing response time.  
  **Relationship Symbol(s):** →  
  **Feedback Type:** –  
- **Limit**: Security constraints can limit performance by creating boundaries—e.g., imposing authentication, which slows down system throughput.  
  **Relationship Symbol(s):** →  
  **Feedback Type:** –  
- **Slow down**: Security controls such as deep packet inspection or strict authentication can slow down overall performance.  
  **Relationship Symbol(s):** →  
  **Feedback Type:** –  
- **Increase overhead**: Additional layers of security, such as encryption, firewalls, or compliance monitoring, increase system overhead and reduce available resources for performance.  
  **Relationship Symbol(s):** →  
  **Feedback Type:** –

#### 2. Influence Verbs (Positive or Neutral Feedback, +/±)

These verbs focus on enhancing or supporting behaviors, where one attribute contributes constructively or mutually to the other.

- **Enhance**: Improvements in performance can enhance security by enabling faster responses to threats, or conversely, robust security can enhance performance integrity.  
  **Relationship Symbol(s):** →  
  **Feedback Type:** +  
- **Support**: Indicates that effective security supports stable performance operations by minimizing disruptions or data loss.  
  **Relationship Symbol(s):** ↔  
  **Feedback Type:** +  
- **Optimize**: Implies a mutual refining process; optimization seeks the best possible equilibrium between performance and security, striving to maximize both attributes in tandem.  
  **Relationship Symbol(s):** ↔  
  **Feedback Type:** +/±  
- **Manage**: Involves active oversight, where performance and security are managed together to achieve operational objectives with minimal trade-offs.  
  **Relationship Symbol(s):** ↔  
  **Feedback Type:** +/±

#### 3. Balance Verbs (Mixed Feedback, ±)

These verbs embody the dynamic or mutual adjustment required to achieve equilibrium depending on context or system needs.

- **Balance**: Represents the continuous process of negotiating between the needs of performance and security to avoid overemphasis on one at the expense of the other.  
  **Relationship Symbol(s):** ↔  
  **Feedback Type:** ±  
- **Trade off**: Encapsulates the need to make deliberate decisions that privilege one aspect (security or performance) over the other due to conflicting requirements.  
  **Relationship Symbol(s):** ↔  
  **Feedback Type:** ±  
- **Weigh**: Indicates the evaluative process—benefits of security are weighed against the costs to performance and vice versa, leading to informed prioritization.  
  **Relationship Symbol(s):** ↔  
  **Feedback Type:** ±  
- **Prioritize**: Focuses on deciding which attribute to address first depending on the threat landscape, business goals, or compliance requirements.  
  **Relationship Symbol(s):** ↔  
  **Feedback Type:** ±

### MECE Check and Completeness

This classification is **mutually exclusive** (there is no overlap between the types of relationships) and **collectively exhaustive** (these categories and verbs cover all relevant relationships between Performance and Security). Each verb appears only once under its appropriate qualitative classification.

### Conceptual Mapping Diagram (Textual)

```
[Security]
   ↑            (Trade-off Verbs: Impact, Affect, Degrade, Limit, Slow down, Increase overhead)       (–)
   ↔ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────→

[Performance]
   ↔            (Influence Verbs: Enhance, Support, Optimize, Manage)        (+/±)
   ↔ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────↔

[Security]
   ↔            (Balance Verbs: Balance, Trade off, Weigh, Prioritize)        (±)
   ↔ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────↔
```
- **Trade-off verbs** highlight the inherent conflicts (arrows showing mutual or one-way negative influence).
- **Influence verbs** show positive or neutral enhancement or support (arrows in both directions indicate mutual influences).
- **Balance verbs** describe ongoing mutual adjustment or negotiation for equilibrium.

### Summary and Practical Implications

By organizing the relationships and associated verbs between Performance and Security into the above MECE-based framework, system designers, architects, and decision-makers can systematically analyze impacts, direct effects, and the necessary ongoing adjustments to achieve the right balance given competing demands. This structured approach promotes clarity and ensures comprehensive, strategic handling of both attributes in technology risk and resource management.
