### MECE Principle Check

#### Mutually Exclusive
- Each quality and its sub-qualities occupy unique and distinct domains without overlap (e.g., security deals with threat prevention, while transparency ensures visibility and traceability).
- Relationship verbs and system impacts are distinct for each quality.

#### Collectively Exhaustive
- When all qualities are combined, they comprehensively span all necessary requirements for a robust, scalable, secure, and capable blockchain-backed big data backend system.
- No major attribute of such a system (security, decentralization, transparency, etc.) is missing.
