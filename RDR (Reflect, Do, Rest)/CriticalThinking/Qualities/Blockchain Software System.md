### Core Qualities and Corresponding Sub-Qualities in Blockchain Software System

Blockchain software systems possess a distinctive set of core qualities—each with related sub-qualities—that collectively define their technological and operational strengths as distributed digital infrastructures((1)). For clarity and rigor, each core quality is detailed with its core verb (relationship type), an explanation clarifying the relationship, grouping by semantic meaning, and further supported with feedback type (+, –, ±). All relationships are represented in a MECE-compliant format, ensuring full coverage without redundancy.

### MECE Principle: Compliance Check

- **Mutually Exclusive:** Each core quality and its sub-qualities represent a non-overlapping aspect of blockchain operation and assurance. For example, Immutability's focus on historical record integrity is distinct from Privacy's emphasis on confidentiality, and Decentralization is exclusive from Security’s technical controls((17)).
- **Collectively Exhaustive:** Together, these qualities span the entire life cycle and operational characteristics essential for blockchain software systems: governance, integrity, verification, security, consensus, efficiency, robustness, automation, and confidentiality((43)).
- **No Redundancy/Gaps:** The structure ensures no critical assessment facet is omitted nor addressed in more than one category.

### Summary and Synthesis

Every core quality of a blockchain software system—decentralization, immutability, transparency, security, consensus, performance, reliability, smart contract capability, and privacy—has clearly defined sub-qualities and core system relationships, expressed through explicit semantic verbs (e.g., distributes, prevents, reveals), and is unambiguously classified by meaning and feedback type((1)). The relationships and diagram provided reinforce a rigorously MECE-compliant structure, supporting clarity for design, evaluation, assurance, and communication in blockchain system engineering.
