In daily life, thousands of ideas may come to mind. It is not feasible to check every idea systematically, considering efficiency. If we consider every idea systematically, it will take too much time (which is likely unnecessary). However, if we take direct actions without any thought check, we could go in the wrong direction. Please list the minimum set of dimensions and corresponding questions to check so that we can mitigate failure risk and go in the right direction. For example, ask 'What if' in anomalies and 'Why is it important?' in priority, 'What are your assumptions?' in assumption.

### Introduction: Balancing Efficiency and Risk in Idea Evaluation

In everyday life, it is common to generate numerous ideas, but evaluating each one systematically can be time-consuming and inefficient, while acting without reflection may lead to misdirection or unnecessary failure risk. To address this challenge, a streamlined framework using a minimal yet effective set of dimensions and corresponding questions can help efficiently filter ideas while mitigating risk. This approach enables you to quickly distinguish promising ideas from less viable ones and provides confidence to pursue the right opportunities.

### 1. Problem and Customer Need (Desirability)

Understanding whether an idea addresses a meaningful problem or need is fundamental to its potential for success. The focus should be on the significance, urgency, and clarity of the issue that the idea aims to solve.

**Key Questions:**
- What is the specific problem or need being addressed?
- Why is this important? (Is the problem urgent or impactful for a defined group?)
- Who are the primary customers or beneficiaries?
- How will you know the problem is effectively solved?

These questions ensure that you are not creating solutions in search of problems, but rather targeting authentic needs with measurable outcomes.

---

### 2. Feasibility and Execution

Even if an idea appears desirable, it is critical to assess whether it can realistically be implemented with available resources, skills, or within contextual constraints. This dimension probes assumptions and surfaces potential obstacles early in the process.

**Key Questions:**
- What are your assumptions about technology, resources, or market conditions?
- What challenges or obstacles could arise? (“What if?” scenarios)
- What skills, tools, or partnerships are required?
- What is a simple, quick way to validate or test the idea before investing heavily?

Reflective questions expose hidden risks and resource needs, allowing for efficient prioritization of next steps or early dismissal of impractical ideas.

### 3. Market Potential and Business Viability

Assessing the potential market size and the viability of the idea as a sustainable activity informs whether investing time and resources is justified. This dimension also covers financial feasibility and paths to value creation.

**Key Questions:**
- Is there a sufficient market size to support this idea?
- Who are the main competitors, and what gaps exist in current solutions?
- What is the value proposition, and how will it generate returns (revenue, impact, or other forms of value)?
- How scalable is the idea?

Understanding market size and viability helps ensure the idea is not just appealing but also practical and substantial enough to warrant pursuit.

---

### 4. Competitive Advantage and Differentiation

Ideas often fail due to inadequate differentiation or ease of imitation by others. This dimension sharpens the focus on unique value and defensibility.

**Key Questions:**
- What unique value does your idea offer?
- What if competitors copy or overshadow this idea? (How robust is your differentiation?)
- How will you maintain or improve your competitive advantage over time?
- Are there barriers (technological, regulatory, strategic) preventing easy imitation?

Reflecting on competitive dynamics helps position your idea for lasting impact and avoids entering saturated or easily contested markets.

---

### 5. Personal and Strategic Fit

Beyond the external environment, personal alignment with the idea is essential for sustained motivation and effective execution. An idea highly suited to your skills, interests, or strategic goals stands a better chance of success and resilience during obstacles or setbacks.

**Key Questions:**
- Do you have the interest, skills, and commitment to pursue this idea?
- How well does this idea align with your broader ambitions or organizational direction?
- Are there personal constraints or resource limitations that could hinder progress?
- What is your contingency plan if the idea does not perform as expected?

Personal fit ensures you are not only capable of pursuing the idea but are likely to remain engaged and resourceful throughout the journey.

### Summary Table: Minimum Set of Dimensions and Questions

| Dimension                          | Representative Questions                                                                |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Problem and Customer Need           | Why is this important? Who needs this? What problem does it solve?                     |
| Feasibility and Execution           | What are your assumptions? What if things go wrong? What resources are required?        |
| Market Potential and Viability      | Is the market size sufficient? Who are competitors? How will it generate value?         |
| Competitive Advantage               | What is unique? What if competitors copy this idea? Are there defensible features?      |
| Personal and Strategic Fit          | Do you have the skills and interest? Does this align with your goals or constraints?    |

### Applying the Framework Efficiently

To maximize efficiency and mitigate risk in daily idea evaluation, it is advisable to run each idea through these five dimensions using the representative questions above. You do not need to pursue exhaustive research—brief reflective answers are often sufficient to filter out ideas with significant flaws or misalignment. Those ideas that clear this preliminary screen can be subjected to further quick validation, such as small-scale customer interviews or minimal prototype development, before committing more substantive resources.

This approach helps avoid both the inefficiency of over-analysis and the hazards of thoughtless action, enabling you to consistently pursue ideas that are both practical and aligned with your strategic intent.

### Conclusion

A minimal and focused checklist based on the five dimensions—Problem & Customer Need, Feasibility & Execution, Market Potential & Viability, Competitive Advantage & Differentiation, and Personal & Strategic Fit—paired with their corresponding critical questions, offers a powerful method to evaluate ideas efficiently. By quickly addressing these aspects, you can filter high-potential ideas for further action while minimizing the risk and cost associated with imprudent pursuits. This balanced and expert-informed approach is well-suited to the fast-paced, idea-rich environment of modern life.
