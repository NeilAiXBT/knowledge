List all core dimensions and corresponding sub-dimensions for evaluating 'Software System Analysis', describe their key relationships, list specific corresponding relationship verbs, classify relationships according to feedback type (negative feedback, positive feedback, or both), identify the collaborators or counterbalances—which themselves are dimensions—among considered dimensions, and check your answer with MECE. Use lists, tables, relationship matrix tables, conceptual mapping diagrams, and other types of diagrams as needed, combining the following symbols for clear relationship demonstration: →, ←, ↔ , etc. Plus use +(positive), -(negative) or ±(both) for feedback type representation, and classify top-level dimensions properly.

Problem Identification
         ↓ (guides, +)
Feasibility Study
         ↓ (informs, +)

Collaborators and Counterbalances:
- Security Design ↔ Performance Design (±, collaboration/trade-off)
- Architectural Design ↔ Scalability (±, tight coupling/counterbalance)
- Requirement Analysis ↔ Evaluation Criteria (±, feedback loop for refinement)
```

### Collaborators and Counterbalances Enumeration

- **Security and Performance Design**: A collaborative pair that requires balancing—enhancing security can affect performance and vice versa, necessitating careful trade-offs for an optimized system.
- **Architectural Design and Scalability**: Tightly interconnected—strong architecture enables scalability, and scalability needs constrain architectural choices.
- **Requirement Analysis and Evaluation Criteria**: These are involved in a continuous feedback loop, ensuring realignment of requirements and priorities as evaluation outcomes are processed.

### Classification of Relationships by Feedback Type

| Relationship                          | Feedback Type | Rationale                                                        |

| Problem Identification → Feasibility Study    | +          | Clear objectives = better feasibility check                       |
| Requirement Analysis → System Modeling        | +          | Accurate requirements yield useful models                        |
| Use Case Diagrams ↔ Data Flow Diagrams        | ±          | Integration validates or requires reworking                       |
| Data Flow Diagrams ↔ Entity-Relationship Diagrams | ±       | Complementary, may challenge assumptions on relationships        |

| System Modeling ↔ Design Evaluation          | ±          | Design feasibility may prompt model backtracking                 |
| Design Evaluation ↔ Evaluation Criteria      | ±          | Quality checks may demand revisiting design                      |

### MECE Check (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

- **Mutually Exclusive:**  
  - Each core dimension addresses a distinct, non-overlapping aspect:  
    - Requirement Analysis (what/why),  
    - System Modeling (how/system behavior),  
    - Design Evaluation (how at the solution/technology level),  
    - Evaluation Criteria (how well/does it meet objectives).
  - Sub-dimensions within each category are clear and do not duplicate others’ functions.

- **Collectively Exhaustive:**  
  - The four dimensions together fully cover the landscape of system analysis from initial exploration to final evaluation.
  - No major element of software system analysis is left unaddressed, including business needs, modeling, design detail, and operational measurement.

#### Visual Representation: Feedback Type Legend

- →, ← : Unidirectional influence (feeds, directs, guides)
- ↔ : Bidirectional/collaborative (integrates, validates and challenges, refines)
- + : Positive feedback (reinforces/progresses)
- - : Negative feedback (dampens/regulates)
- ± : Both positive and negative feedback (mutual refinement)
