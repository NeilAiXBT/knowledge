### Introduction to Information Quality Dimensions

Evaluating information quality is essential for ensuring that data supports robust, effective, and unbiased decision-making in any organizational context. Information quality (also known as data quality) is multi-dimensional and encompasses distinct properties that together determine whether a dataset is reliable, useful, and fit for its intended purpose. These dimensions range from technical attributes, such as validity and accuracy, to contextual attributes like usefulness and timeliness. For clarity, efficiency, and comprehensiveness, an information quality framework must follow the MECE principleâ€”each dimension should be mutually exclusive (no overlaps) and collectively exhaustive (covering all aspects with no gaps).

### Comprehensive List of Information Quality Dimensions

Below is a thorough list of dimensions for evaluating information quality, including strength, completeness, accuracy, reliability, and others, consolidating industry-leading frameworks and authoritative sources.

| Dimension        | Definition |
|------------------|------------|
| **Accuracy**     | The degree to which data correctly reflects the real-world entities or events it intends to describe. |
| **Completeness** | The extent to which all necessary data is present for a given context, process, or requirement. |
| **Consistency**  | The uniformity of data across sources, formats, or time; data values should not contradict one another. |
| **Validity**     | The degree to which data conforms to the predefined formats, rules, types, or value ranges set by the context or business requirements. |
| **Uniqueness**   | Ensuring that each entity is represented only once, eliminating redundant or duplicate records. |
| **Timeliness**   | Availability of data within the relevant time frame for its intended use, ensuring it is up-to-date. |
| **Reliability**  | The dependability and stability of data over time, ensuring results are consistent under repeated conditions. |
| **Usefulness (Strength)** | The degree to which data is relevant, applicable, and valuable for supporting specific business objectives or decisions. |
| **Currency**     | The extent to which data matches the most current state of the real world at the time of use, reflecting any recent updates or changes. |
| **Conformity**   | Adherence of data to agreed-upon standards, formats, and conventions within and across datasets. |
| **Integrity**    | Maintenance of valid, accurate relationships and associations within and between datasets (e.g., referential integrity). |
| **Availability** | Accessibility of data to authorized users when and where required((224)). |
| **Precision**    | The granularity or level of detail to which data values are recorded and expressed. |
| **Lineage**      | The traceability of data, documenting its origin, transformations, and movements throughout systems to maintain auditability and trust. |
| **Representation** | The clarity and consistency in how data is displayed, including the use of metadata and documentation for proper understanding. |
| **Differences (Comparability)** | The extent to which changes, discrepancies, or anomalies between data versions or datasets can be detected and analyzed. |

### Relationships Between Information Quality Dimensions and Relationship Verbs

The various dimensions of information quality are not isolated; they interact and support one another through a network of dependencies and effects. These relationships can be described with specific relationship verbs, clarifying how one dimension influences or relies on another. Below are key relationships and typical verbs used to articulate them:

- **Depends on / Built on**: Certain dimensions require others to be present or strong. For example, *accuracy depends on completeness and validity*, as correct data presupposes that all necessary fields are available and conform to rules((612)).
- **Supports / Enables**: Dimensions that underpin the function of others. For instance, *completeness supports reliability*, as missing data undermines trustworthiness.
- **Ensures / Guarantees**: Directly assures or provides a foundation. *Uniqueness ensures completeness and integrity*, preventing duplicated records.
- **Reflects / Represents**: Demonstrates or embodies another property. *Currency reflects timeliness and accuracy*, as up-to-date data must first be timely and correct.
- **Conforms to / Adheres to**: Indicates compliance with constraints. *Validity conforms to required formats and ranges*.
- **Affects / Impacts**: Changes in one dimension influence another. *Timeliness affects usefulness*, since outdated data is less helpful.
- **Captures / Detects**: Highlights discrepancies. *Differences capture anomalies and changes that reveal issues in consistency and accuracy*.
- **Complements / Aligns with**: Works together with. *Currency complements timeliness*, as both relate to the temporal aspect of data.
- **Measures / Quantifies**: Used for assessment. *Precision measures the detail level in data values*.

### Examples of Inter-Dimensional Relationships

- **Accuracy depends on Validity and Completeness**: Accurate data must be both valid (adhering to rules and formats) and complete (containing all required fields).
- **Completeness supports Reliability**: If required data is missing, users cannot consistently trust its results.
- **Consistency ensures Reliability and depends on Conformity**: Consistent data indicates stable, repeated outcomes and requires adherence to data standards((491)).
- **Uniqueness supports Integrity and Completeness**: Eliminating duplicates preserves one-to-one relationships and ensures all individual entities are uniquely represented.
- **Timeliness affects Usefulness and reflects Currency**: Data must be current and delivered promptly to be valuable in decision-making.
- **Differences capture Consistency and Accuracy Issues**: By analyzing data variations, discrepancies that affect consistency or correctness can be identified.
- **Conformity supports Consistency and Validity**: Adhering to standards makes it easier to ensure data is both uniform and valid.
- **Availability enables Usefulness**: Even perfect data loses value if it is not accessible to end users when needed.
- **Representation enhances Usefulness and Understanding**: Clear presentation supports correct interpretation and utility.

### MECE Principle Assessment

#### Mutual Exclusivity

Each information quality dimension defined above is uniquely scoped to avoid overlap:
- **Accuracy** is about correctness, not just presence (Completeness), format adherence (Validity), or recency (Timeliness).
- **Completeness** tracks missing data, separate from correctness or uniqueness.
- **Consistency** is about uniformity, distinct from correctness or presence((795)).
- **Validity** focuses solely on rule conformance, rather than correctness or presence.
- **Uniqueness** addresses the problem of duplicate records, unrelated to value correctness or completeness.
- **Timeliness/Currency** are about temporal fitness, not other facets.
- **Reliability** is a longitudinal quality, concerning outcomes over time, not merely current correctness.
- **Usefulness** is contextual and subjective, depending on business need.
- All remaining dimensions add further facets without overlap (see table above for clear separation).

This structure ensures no dimension is wholly included within another, satisfying mutual exclusivity.

#### Collective Exhaustiveness

As a comprehensive set, the listed dimensions cover all relevant, non-overlapping aspects necessary to determine data's overall fitness for use in technical, business, and operational environments. They incorporate intrinsic, contextual, relational, and comparative dimensions, leaving no meaningful gaps for standard data quality evaluation.

### Classification of Information Quality Dimensions (MECE-Compliant)

Below is a MECE-aligned classification that both avoids overlap and ensures all necessary quality attributes are represented:

| Category Description      | Included Dimensions                                                                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Core Intrinsic**        | Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency, Validity, Uniqueness, Precision                                    |
| **Contextual**            | Timeliness, Currency, Usefulness, Availability, Representation                                          |
| **Relational/Governance** | Integrity, Lineage, Reliability, Conformity                                                             |
| **Analytical/Comparative**| Differences (Comparability)                                                                             |

#### Explanation:

- **Core Intrinsic Dimensions**: Assess the inherent properties and correctness of data, regardless of use or context.
- **Contextual Dimensions**: Relate data quality to timing, relevance, access, and clarity based on use-case or user needs.
- **Relational/Governance Dimensions**: Address relationships, governance, traceability, and assurance-related attributes of data.
- **Analytical/Comparative Dimensions**: Involve monitoring and detection of changes or discrepancies between data sets, critical for validation and evolution.

Each category is mutually exclusive, grouping dimensions that address different foundational ideas, while collectively, they exhaustively represent all essential qualities of information.

### Conclusion

A rigorous, MECE-compliant framework for evaluating information quality includes well-defined dimensions such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, validity, uniqueness, timeliness, reliability, usefulness, currency, conformity, integrity, availability, precision, lineage, representation, and differences. These dimensions interact through support, dependency, assurance, and comparative relationships, clarified by relationship verbs such as depends on, supports, ensures, reflects, conforms to, affects, and captures (among others). Classification into intrinsic, contextual, relational, and analytical categories preserves both mutual exclusivity and collective exhaustiveness, enabling comprehensive, clear, and actionable information quality assessment in any context.
