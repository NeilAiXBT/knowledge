#### 2. Material Resources
- **Definition**: Tangible physical items needed to execute plans
- **Subcategories**:

### Alternative MECE Classifications

#### By Ownership
- **Internal Resources**: Owned or controlled by the organization
- **External Resources**: Provided by third parties or partners

#### By Availability
- **Dedicated Resources**: Exclusively allocated to specific plans
- **Shared Resources**: Utilized across multiple plans or departments

#### By Criticality

This MECE framework provides planners with a comprehensive understanding of all resource types needed for effective planning while ensuring categories remain distinct and collectively cover all possibilities.
