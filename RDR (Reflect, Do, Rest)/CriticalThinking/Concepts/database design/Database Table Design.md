### Concept

Database table design is the structured process of organizing data into tables, each representing a real-world or abstract entity, with the aim of ensuring efficient data storage, retrieval, and integrity in relational database systems.

### 1. Definitions

1. Table: A set of rows (records/tuples), where each row represents one instance of an entity, and columns (fields/attributes) describe entity properties.  
   *Example:* A "Products" table with columns `ProductID`, `ProductName`, and `Price`.

2. Primary Key (PK): One or more columns whose values uniquely identify each row in a table.  
   *Example:* `CustomerID` in a "Customers" table ensures every customer is unique.

3. Foreign Key (FK): A column or set of columns that links rows to those in another table, enforcing referential integrity.  
   *Example:* `Order.CustomerID` referencing `Customers.CustomerID`.

4. Schema: The formal definition of a table or database structure, including data types, keys, and constraints.  
   *Example:* Declaring `Price` as a `DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL` in a "Products" table.

### 2. Laws

1. Legal and Regulatory: Data privacy and security laws (such as HIPAA or GDPR) mandate the design of database tables to protect sensitive data, enforce access control, and maintain auditability.  
   *Example:* Only authorized clinicians may view or update patient data in a healthcare database.

2. Technical (ACID): Database tables must support Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability to guarantee reliable transaction processing.  
   *Example:* Ensuring that a bank transfer updates both sender and receiver balances together or not at all.

3. Industry Standards: SQL and relational database standards enforce predictable syntax for defining tables, keys, and constraints.  
   *Example:* Using `UNIQUE` constraints for email addresses in a user table.

### 3. Axioms

1. Armstrong’s Axioms:
   1. Reflexivity: If Y is a subset of X, then X functionally determines Y (X → Y).  
      *Example:* (`EmployeeID`, `Name`) → `Name`.
   2. Augmentation: If X → Y, then for any Z, XZ → YZ.  
      *Example:* If `StudentID` → `Name`, then (`StudentID`, `CourseID`) → (`Name`, `CourseID`).
   3. Transitivity: If X → Y and Y → Z, then X → Z.  
      *Example:* `OrderID` → `CustomerID`, and `CustomerID` → `Address`, so `OrderID` → `Address`.

2. Secondary Rules:  
   1. Union: If X → Y and X → Z, then X → YZ.  
      *Example:* If `StudentID` → `Name` and `StudentID` → `Email`, then `StudentID` → (`Name`, `Email`).
   2. Decomposition: If X → YZ, then X → Y and X → Z.  
      *Example:* If `ProjectID` → (`Budget`, `Deadline`), then `ProjectID` → `Budget` and `ProjectID` → `Deadline`.

### 4. Theories

1. Relational Model Theory: Data is organized in tables (relations), defined by set theory and first-order logic, where tables represent sets of tuples and operations are based on relational algebra.  
   *Example:* `Employee` and `Department` tables with relationships represented via keys.

2. Functional Dependency Theory: Attributes are functionally dependent if one attribute's value determines another’s, foundational for normalization and schema design.  
   *Example:* In "Employee", `EmployeeID` → `DepartmentID`.

3. Normalization Theory: Applies a sequence of steps (normal forms) to decompose tables and reduce redundancy and anomalies.  
   *Example:* Converting a flat sales table to separate tables for products, customers, and orders.

4. Entity-Relationship (ER) Theory: Uses graphical models to abstractly represent entities and their interrelationships before logical implementation.  
   *Example:* An ER diagram with entities "Student", "Course", and relationship "Enrollment".

### 5. Principles

1. Normalization: Systematically refines tables to reduce data redundancy and improve consistency by achieving normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF).  
   *Example:* Extracting repeating addresses into a separate "Addresses" table.

2. Data Integrity: Enforces primary and foreign key constraints, and applies validation rules to ensure data correctness.  
   *Example:* Foreign key prevents "Order" records with nonexistent `CustomerID`s.

3. Atomicity: Each column value should be indivisible and of a single type.  
   *Example:* Storing `FirstName` and `LastName` in separate columns rather than a single `FullName`.

4. Clarity and Uniqueness: Keys must uniquely distinguish each record (no duplicates; PK columns are never NULL).  
   *Example:* The `EmployeeID` column serves as primary key in "Employee".

5. Referential Integrity: FKs enforce valid links to related tables, supporting consistent relationships.  
   *Example:* Ensuring every invoice's `CustomerID` refers to an existing customer.

6. Appropriate Indexing: Indexes support fast query performance and must be carefully considered when designing tables.  
   *Example:* Indexing `Email` for fast login lookups.

### 6. Frameworks

1. Database Design Lifecycle Framework:
   1. Requirements Gathering: Identify data storage, processing, and security requirements.
      *Example:* Interview company staff to document order tracking needs.
   2. Conceptual Design: Model entities, attributes, and relationships using high-level diagrams (usually ER diagrams).
      *Example:* Create a diagram for "Book", "Author", and "Publisher" in a library.
   3. Logical Design: Translate conceptual model into table structures with normalization.
      *Example:* Assign primary keys, define columns, and apply normalization up to 3NF.
   4. Physical Design: Specify storage details, indexes, and physical structure aligned with the chosen DBMS.
      *Example:* Define storage requirements and table partitioning for large transaction logs.
   5. Implementation and Testing: Build tables, load data, and validate data and query performance.
      *Example:* Run test cases to verify unique constraints for user emails.

2. Methodological Approaches:
   1. Top-Down: Start from global requirements and design down to detailed tables.
      *Example:* From a business process map, derive a logical data model.
   2. Bottom-Up: Begin from existing data structures, refine and group into logical tables.
      *Example:* Rationalize legacy flat files into normalized relational tables.

### 7. Models

1. Entity-Relationship Model: A conceptual visual model defining entities, attributes, and their relationships.
   *Example:* Model with "Student", "Course", and "Enrollment" entities.

2. Relational Model: Defines schema as interrelated tables, each implementing entity or relationship described in the ER model.
   *Example:* "OrderItems" table links "Orders" and "Products" via FKs.

3. Normalized Data Models: Tables adjusted to conform to normal forms up to at least 3NF, possibly BCNF.
   *Example:* Decomposition of an order-entry flat table into "Customers", "Orders", and "OrderItems".

4. Physical Data Model: Adds storage specifications, data types, indexes, partitions, based on the logical model and the specific DBMS.
   *Example:* Implementing a "Users" table with `INTEGER` PK, `VARCHAR` email, and indexing.

### 8. Patterns

1. Normalized Form Pattern: Organizes tables to meet 1NF–3NF, preventing redundancy and update anomalies.
   *Example:* Splitting a "Sales" table into "Sales", "Customers", and "Products".

2. Denormalized Pattern: Intentionally includes redundancy for performance, as in some reporting/warehousing scenarios.
   *Example:* Adding "CustomerName" redundantly in "Orders" for faster read queries.

3. Master-Detail Pattern: Parent-child relationship modeled as one-to-many, e.g., "Invoice" and "InvoiceLine" tables.
   *Example:* "Order" as master, "OrderItems" as child table.

4. Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) Pattern: Models sparse or highly variable attributes via generic attribute tables.
   *Example:* Medical system storing varying lab results per patient.

5. Ternary/Associative Entity Pattern: Models many-to-many relationships and joins between three or more entities.
   *Example:* "Enrollment" table linking "Students", "Courses", and "Semesters".

6. Star Schema Pattern: Central fact table connected to dimension tables (data warehouse pattern).
   *Example:* "SalesFact" table linked to "Date", "Product", and "Customer" dimensions.

7. Snowflake Schema: Extends star schema by normalizing dimension tables.
   *Example:* "Product" dimension split into "Product", "Category", and "Supplier".
