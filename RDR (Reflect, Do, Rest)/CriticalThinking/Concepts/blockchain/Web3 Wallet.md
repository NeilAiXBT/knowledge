### 1. Concept

A Web3 wallet is a digital solution purpose-built to enable users to manage, store, and interact with digital assets and decentralized applications (dApps) on blockchain-based networks, serving as both an identity management gateway and a tool for accessing the decentralized Web3 ecosystem((1)). Unlike traditional wallets, which focus mainly on the storage and transfer of fiat or cryptocurrencies in centralized environments, Web3 wallets provide the infrastructure for managing not only digital currencies but also digital identity, NFTs, and permissions, reinforcing decentralization by eliminating trusted intermediaries((9)).

### 2. Definitions

1. **Technical (Software Layer)**
   1) A Web3 wallet is a software interface that safeguards a user's private and public keys, signs blockchain transactions, and authenticates user access to various decentralized services((309)).
   2) Example: MetaMask stores private keys locally and signs transactions for Ethereum-based networks((41)).

2. **User Perspective**
   1) Web3 wallets are tools that give users control over their digital assets, enabling sending, receiving, and interacting with tokens, NFTs, and dApps on multiple networks with no imposed central guidance((92)).
   2) Example: Trust Wallet can hold thousands of tokens and manage NFTs across several blockchains((2227)).

3. **Industry/Classification**
   1) Web3 wallets are classified as either non-custodial, where the user controls private keys, or custodial, where third parties manage keys and sometimes provide recovery options((314)).
   2) Example: Ledger hardware wallet (non-custodial), Coinbase Wallet (custodial option within a larger exchange)((170)).

### 3. Laws

1. **Legal and Regulatory Compliance**
   1) Cryptocurrency wallet services must comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) obligations in many jurisdictions, especially if operating custodial services or offering fiat onramps((712)).
   2) Example: US-based custodial wallets must register as money service businesses and gather user identity data((1019)).

2. **Data Privacy and Security**
   1) Wallets operating globally need to follow regional privacy laws like the EU GDPR and Japan’s Personal Information Protection Law, particularly if any form of user data can be linked to a natural person((825)).
   2) Example: Web3 wallets in the EU must obtain user consent and use secure encryption to handle key data((829)).

3. **Asset Segregation and Consumer Protection**
   1) Regulations often require custodial wallet providers to segregate user assets from corporate assets and disclose risk transparently((738)).
   2) Example: Japan’s Payment Services Act mandates that customer crypto assets be managed via reliable methods like cold wallets and backed by compensation funds if online((739)).

### 4. Axioms

1. **Ownership Equals Control**
   1) Whomever possesses the private keys ultimately controls the assets; this is the foundation of self-custody((16)).
   2) Example: If a user loses their MetaMask seed phrase, they lose access to wallet assets forever((495)).

2. **Decentralization and Trustlessness**
   1) All operations executed through a Web3 wallet can be verified by the network and require no trust in intermediaries((100)).
   2) Example: Phantom wallet transactions are signed and broadcast directly to the relevant blockchain((2284)).

3. **Transparency and Immutability**
   1) All actions (transactions, signatures, ownership updates) are publicly recorded, immutable, and verifiable on blockchains((258)).
   2) Example: Every NFT transfer is mapped transparently on Etherscan when using wallets like Rainbow((2279)).

### 5. Theories

1. **Network Effects Theory**
   1) Wallet adoption and utility increase as more dApps and protocols integrate support, leading to a virtuous adoption cycle((1204)).
   2) Example: MetaMask’s wide dApp compatibility makes it more valuable as the ecosystem grows((1232)).

2. **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Theory**
   1) Web3 wallets are believed to empower users to manage digital identity credentials without the need for central authorities, shifting the paradigm from platform-controlled to user-controlled identity((1168)).
   2) Example: Wallet Connect and decentralized ID standards enable login via wallet signature((2317)).

3. **Platformization and Horseshoe Wallet Theory**
   1) Wallets evolve by integrating ancillary services (trading, staking, NFT management, chat) to onboard indirect network effects and retain users, moving towards "thin platforms"((1204)).
   2) Example: MetaMask Snaps allows developers to plug new features into the wallet, increasing jobs served and platform stickiness((1232)).

4. **Recoverability and Privacy Enhancement Theory**
   1) The adoption of features like social recovery (ERC-4337) and distributed computation (MPC) emerges from the need to combine resilience and privacy despite decentralization((251)).
   2) Example: Argent wallet implements guardians for recoverability, blending security with usability((192)).

### 6. Principles

1. **Security**
   1) Private key generation, storage, and user authentication should use industry-standard cryptography, and features like multi-factor or biometric authentication are desirable((1372)).
   2) Example: Ledger devices utilize secure elements and require PIN verification((2249)).

2. **Privacy**
   1) Wallets should minimize passive data exposure and provide features like address rotation, HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallets, and encrypted communications((1483)).
   2) Example: Many wallets generate new addresses for each transaction to enhance user anonymity((584)).

3. **Decentralization**
   1) User autonomy is paramount; wallets should empower full ownership and control over digital assets, minimizing dependencies on central actors((19)).
   2) Example: Trust Wallet never collects or stores users’ keys on centralized servers((119)).

4. **Transparency**
   1) Robust transaction and code audit logs, open-source implementations, and clear smart contract events should be emphasized((1743)).
   2) Example: MetaMask is open source and displays network interactions clearly for user inspection((2220)).

5. **Interoperability**
   1) Supporting multiple blockchains and standardized APIs or connection protocols is critical to streamline multi-chain participation((23)).
   2) Example: OKX Wallet supports over 50 blockchains in one unified interface((2268)).

6. **Usability and Accessibility**
   1) Simple, intuitive interfaces, documentation, and recovery options lower onboarding friction and foster adoption((1506)).
   2) Example: Exodus wallet focuses on an intuitive, accessible multi-platform interface((2332)).

### 7. Frameworks

1. **Functional Layer (Stack) Approach**
   1) Wallet analysis can be structured into layers: Security & Key Management, Blockchain Connectivity, Core Utility (asset transfer, staking, NFT handling), and User Interface((1829)).
   2) Example: Trust Wallet (fat wallet) scores highly across stacks; Uniswap Wallet (lean) specializes in swaps((1835)).

2. **Feature Specificity vs. Ecosystem Coverage Matrix**
   1) Wallets are positioned along axes of feature specialization (breadth) vs. ecosystem coverage (multi-chain or single-chain)((1822)).
   2) Example: Phantom specializes in Solana and NFTs, Zerion in DeFi tracking with multi-chain support((2284)).

3. **Monetizability vs. Substitutability Matrix**
   1) Wallets are analyzed by features that are easy to monetize (built-in swaps, DEX integrations) versus those with low substitutability (community-building, staking, social feeds)((1842)).
   2) Example: MetaMask Swap earns high fees and reduces user shift due to aggregation and platform integrations((1838)).

4. **Embedded vs. Standalone Wallets**
   1) Framework separates embedded dApp-integrated wallets from universal standalone apps to map flexibility and lock-in((1850)).
   2) Example: Friend.Tech wallet is embedded for specific social trading, while MetaMask is a universal wallet((1851)).

### 8. Models

1. **Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Wallet Model**
   1) Custodial: Third-party controls keys; easier onboarding but introduces trust risk.
   2) Non-custodial: User controls all keys; maximal control and responsibility((314)).
   3) Example: Coinbase Wallet (custodial), MetaMask (non-custodial)((2222)).

2. **Hot vs. Cold Wallet Model**
   1) Hot: Connected to the internet; convenient for daily use but more vulnerable.
   2) Cold: Offline storage (hardware, paper); highly secure but less accessible((332)).
   3) Example: MetaMask (hot), Ledger/Trezor (cold)((2249)).

3. **Smart Contract Wallet Model**
   1) Wallets governed by programmable logic, enabling advanced features like multi-sig, scheduled payments, social recovery((229)).
   2) Example: Gnosis Safe multi-signature wallet((191)).

4. **MPC (Multi-Party Computation) Wallets**
   1) Private key is split and managed among multiple parties, increasing resilience and eliminating single points of failure((347)).
   2) Example: ZenGo’s MPC applied to mobile wallets((2281)).

5. **User Interaction Flow Model**
   1) Standardized workflow: Create/restore wallet → backup seed/MPC → asset receipt/transfer → dApp authentication → transaction confirmation((287)).
   2) Example: Rainbow’s onboarding and daily usage for NFT minting and dApp browsing((2279)).

### 9. Patterns

1. **Seed Phrase and HD Wallet Pattern**
   1) Use of 12-24 word BIP39 mnemonic phrases for deterministic wallet key derivation, supporting backup and recovery((2366)).
   2) Example: MetaMask’s onboarding routine((2194)).

2. **Multi-Signature Security Pattern**
   1) Transactions require approval from multiple keyholders, reducing single-point compromise risk((352)).
   2) Example: Gnosis Safe uses n-of-m multisig for treasury management((2286)).

3. **Social Recovery Pattern**
   1) Private keys can be restored via trusted social contacts or distributed shares, blending usability and resilience((251)).
   2) Example: Argent recovery via "guardians" (friends/devices)((192)).

4. **MPC Key Distribution Pattern**
   1) Key shares are distributed among devices/providers; no single holder can reconstruct the full key((1169)).
   2) Example: ZenGo uses this architecture for self-custody wallets((2281)).

5. **Integration Pattern**
   1) Seamless dApp and marketplace integration for trading, gaming, or social uses directly in the wallet((11)).
   2) Example: Phantom integrates with Magic Eden for direct NFT listings((2284)).
