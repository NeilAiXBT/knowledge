### 1. Concept

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a computer programming paradigm that organizes software around objects, which encapsulate data and functions, rather than relying solely on logic and procedures as in traditional programming styles((1)). It models real-world and abstract entities through data fields (attributes) and behaviors (methods), providing a more intuitive framework for managing complexity in large or evolving systems((62)).

### 2. Definitions

1. Object: An instance of a class containing state (attributes), behavior (methods), and identity.  
   - Example: A “Dog” object with name and breed as attributes, and bark() as a method((138)).

2. Class: A blueprint or template that defines the attributes and methods common to its instances((191)).  
   - Example: The “Car” class defines that all cars have wheels, color, and methods like start() and stop()((136)).

3. Method: A function defined within a class that describes the behavior of its objects((199)).  
   - Example: accelerate() increases the speed of a “Car” object.

4. Message Passing: Objects interact by sending messages (calling methods), allowing for dynamic behavior and decoupling((406)).  
   - Example: A “User” object may send a message to a “Payment” object to process a payment.

### 3. Laws

1. Encapsulation Law: Objects hide their internal states and only expose selected interfaces for manipulation, ensuring data integrity and modularity((413)).  
   - Example: Private attributes in a “BankAccount” are managed via public deposit() and withdraw() methods((880)).

2. Inheritance Law: Classes can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes, enabling code reuse and logical hierarchies((414)).  
   - Example: A “Bird” class serves as a base for “Pigeon” and “Sparrow” classes, both inheriting wings and fly() methods((853)).

3. Polymorphism Law: The same operation can behave differently across different classes, promoting flexibility and extensibility((415)).  
   - Example: draw() works differently for “Circle” and “Rectangle” classes, both inheriting from “Shape”((1254)).

4. Abstraction Law: Only essential information is exposed; unnecessary implementation details are hidden from the user((19)).  
   - Example: A “Car” abstracts driving; the user does not need to know the internal workings of the engine((140)).

5. SOLID Principles as Laws:  
   - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion provide detailed guidelines for robust OOP design((695)).

### 4. Axioms

1. Independence Axiom: Components or objects should function independently, minimizing dependencies((773)).  
   - Example: “Customer” and “Inventory” classes manage their responsibilities separately, reducing tight coupling((825)).

2. Information Axiom: The design should minimize information content—simplicity is preferred((773)).  
   - Example: Using a built-in sort() method in a “List” class instead of a custom sorting function makes the system easier to maintain((795)).

3. Encapsulation as an Axiom: Data and operations are inseparable at the object level((772)).  
   - Example: “Employee” class bundles attributes like name and methods like calculatePayroll() together.

### 5. Theories

1. Real-World Modeling Theory: Software should mirror real-world entities and their relationships as interacting objects((656)).  
   - Example: A hospital information system represents doctors, patients, and appointments as objects with real interactions.

2. Behavioral Subtyping (Liskov Substitution): Subtypes should be substitutable for their supertypes without altering desirable program properties((674)).  
   - Example: Any instance of a “Rectangle” should be usable where a “Shape” is expected.

3. Formal Semantics: Objects are rigorously defined entities with algebraic properties for precise reasoning and static analysis((807)).  
   - Example: “Stack” and “Queue” types are specified using mathematical axioms governing their operations.

### 6. Principles

1. Encapsulation: Bundling data and related methods, restricting access to internal state((1207)).  
   - Example: The “Student” class hides GPA as a private field and manages it through setGPA() and getGPA()((247)).

2. Abstraction: Focusing on relevant details, hiding complex implementation((140)).  
   - Example: “RemoteControl” interface abstracts control while device implementation details are hidden.

3. Inheritance: Creating new classes from base classes for specialized behavior((274)).  
   - Example: “Truck” inherits from “Vehicle,” adding loadCapacity attribute.

4. Polymorphism: Allowing the same interface or operation to apply to multiple object types((289)).  
   - Example: A print() method used for both PDF and WordDocument objects((1254)).

### 7. Frameworks

1. System Infrastructure Frameworks: Provide reusable architectural skeletons for platform-level functionality((1447)).  
   - Example: Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) for GUI development.

2. Middleware Integration Frameworks: Facilitate distributed application development and communication((1545)).  
   - Example: CORBA and Java RMI for remote object interaction.

3. Enterprise Application Frameworks: Support business domain-specific applications with extensibility((1553)).  
   - Example: Spring Framework for Java enables dependency injection and AOP in enterprise software((1943)).

### 8. Models

1. Class-Based Model: Objects are instantiated from classes, with hierarchies forming the backbone of the system((660)).  
   - Example: In Java, a “Person” class leads to many “Person” objects in the program((191)).

2. Prototype-Based Model: Objects inherit directly from other objects (prototypes), mainly used in JavaScript((669)).  
   - Example: A “fruit” prototype leads to “apple” and “orange” objects.

3. Responsibility Assignment Model: Distributes behavior among objects based on specific responsibilities, aiding modularity((693)).  
   - Example: In an e-commerce system, “Order” objects manage checkout, “Inventory” updates stock.

4. Sequence and Class Diagrams: Visual models representing object interaction and structure((11)).  
   - Example: UML diagrams for online booking system show classes and message flows.

### 9. Patterns

1. Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance accessible globally((1954)).  
   - Example: “Logger” object manages application-wide logging((2135)).

2. Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating objects, letting subclasses alter object types((1960)).  
   - Example: A “ShapeFactory” creates “Circle” or “Square” objects as needed((2164)).

3. Observer: Establishes a one-to-many dependency so when one object changes, others are notified automatically((2013)).  
   - Example: A “Subject” notifies all “Observer” objects when its state changes (e.g., GUI widgets listening for updates).

4. Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulated interchangeably((2021)).  
   - Example: Different sorting strategies (QuickSort, MergeSort) switchable at runtime for a “Sorter” object.

5. Decorator: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects((1996)).  
   - Example: Coffee order object is decorated with options like milk or caramel.

6. Composite: Composes objects into tree structures for part-whole hierarchies((2004)).  
   - Example: File system directories (folders) and files are modeled using the composite pattern.
