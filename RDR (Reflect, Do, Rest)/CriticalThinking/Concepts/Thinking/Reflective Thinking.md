### Concept

1. Reflective thinking is a deliberate cognitive process in which an individual consciously examines, analyzes, and evaluates their knowledge, experiences, and assumptions, with the aim of gaining deeper understanding, informing learning, and guiding future actions.
   - Example: A teacher critically reviewing a classroom activity to determine what worked and planning improvements for future lessons.

2. It is characterized by intentional self-questioning, the integration of past knowledge with present situations, and a focus on connecting thought to action for personal and professional growth.
   - Example: An entrepreneur reflecting on a failed business strategy to extract insights for the next venture.

### Definitions

1. John Dewey's definition: "Active, persistent, and careful consideration of any belief or supposed knowledge in light of the grounds that support it and the further conclusions to which it tends".
   - Example: An engineer pausing to reconsider the rationale behind a design choice after encountering a malfunction.
   
2. Reflective thinking involves consciously thinking about and analyzing what you are currently doing, what you have done before, what you have experienced, and what and how you have learned.
   - Example: A medical student writing a journal entry to process what was learned during a clinical rotation.

3. It is a metacognitive process of analyzing and evaluating one's own thoughts, experiences, and actions to improve decision-making.
   - Example: An athlete replaying and analyzing a recent game to identify behaviors for adjustment.

### Laws

1. Law of Reflective Action: Reflective thinking must result in tangible action—insights gained from reflection should be tested through practice or experimentation.
   - Example: A chef adjusting recipes based on previous feedback and observing results in the next meal service.

2. Law of Sequential Engagement: Reflection involves a sequence: recognition of a problem or anomaly, definition, hypothesis generation, reasoning through implications, and practical testing.
   - Example: A student addressing a poor test performance by identifying causes, generating strategies, and applying new study methods.

3. Law of Pause for Insight: Intentionally pausing to reflect allows for growth and learning by converting experience into actionable insight.
   - Example: A manager scheduling regular reflection sessions with the team to capture lessons from ongoing projects.

### Axioms

1. Experience as Origin: All reflection originates from an actual experience or perceived event.
   - Example: A pilot conducting a debrief after a challenging flight maneuver.

2. Active Engagement: Reflection is not passive rumination; it is active inquiry into one’s own beliefs, actions, and their consequences.
   - Example: A scientist rigorously evaluating the methodology and results of a research experiment.

3. Purposefulness: The reflective process is always directed towards a goal—problem-solving, understanding, or improvement.
   - Example: An HR specialist reflecting on exit interview data to identify improvements for employee retention.

4. Openness to Multiple Perspectives: Reflection demands openness to challenge personal assumptions and consider diverse viewpoints.
   - Example: A community organizer actively soliciting feedback from different stakeholders to refine outreach strategies.

### Theories

1. Dewey’s Reflective Thinking Theory: Involves five steps—identifying a difficulty, defining the problem, developing hypotheses, reasoning through possible solutions, and empirically testing outcomes.
   - Example: A project leader systematically addressing a bottleneck by clarifying the issue, brainstorming fixes, and testing new workflows.

2. Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle: Proposes learning as a continuous process through four stages—Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualization, and Active Experimentation.
   - Example: A marketing team member applying lessons from a past campaign by conceptualizing new strategies and testing them in future launches.

3. Schön’s Reflective Practitioner: Distinguishes reflection-in-action (reflection during activity) and reflection-on-action (retrospective reflection after activity).
   - Example: A nurse adjusting patient care in the moment (in-action) and reviewing outcomes post-shift (on-action).

4. Gibbs' Reflective Cycle Theory: Breaks reflection into six structured stages—Description, Feelings, Evaluation, Analysis, Conclusion, Action Plan.
   - Example: A graduate student reviewing a group project by sequentially documenting each stage of thought and emotion.

### Principles

1. Reflection Drives Continuous Improvement: Reflection must result in iteration and action for ongoing development.
   - Example: A coach routinely reflecting on practice drills to optimize athlete performance.
   
2. Theory-Practice Integration: Comparison of lived experiences with theories enhances reflective depth.
   - Example: An engineer aligning field data with technical models to refine design processes.

3. Critical Objectivity: Effective reflection requires suspending premature judgments and examining both strengths and weaknesses of experiences.
   - Example: A journalist reviewing coverage for both bias and balance.

4. Self-Awareness: Recognizing one’s own emotions, motives, and biases is essential for authentic reflection.
   - Example: An artist reflecting on how personal feelings influenced creative output.

5. Time and Environmental Support: Deliberate reflection needs protected time and a conducive environment.
   - Example: A therapist blocking out time for end-of-day case review.

### Frameworks

1. 5R Framework (Reporting, Responding, Relating, Reasoning, Reconstructing): Guides stepwise critical engagement with experiences.
   - Example: A student analyzing a challenging client interaction through each of the 5R stages.

2. Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle: Concrete Experience → Reflective Observation → Abstract Conceptualization → Active Experimentation.
   - Example: A teacher using student feedback (experience and observation) to conceptualize new teaching methods and testing them.

3. Gibbs' Reflective Cycle: Structured around Description, Feelings, Evaluation, Analysis, Conclusion, and Action Plan.
   - Example: A nurse systematically evaluating a critical incident using Gibbs’ framework for future protocols.

4. What? So What? Now What? (Rolfe et al.): Three-stage reflection—describe situation, interpret significance, plan action((826)).
   - Example: A business analyst resolving project setbacks using each reflective question.

5. DEAL Model (Describe, Examine, Articulate Learning): Focused on evidence-based reflection for personal or academic growth.
   - Example: A service-learning student reflecting on community engagement experiences.

### Models

1. Gibbs' Reflective Cycle Model: Provides a comprehensive loop through six sequential stages to promote self-awareness and actionable learning.
   - Example: Teacher reflecting on a lesson, identifying emotions, evaluating effectiveness, analyzing factors, drawing conclusions, and planning.

2. Driscoll's Model (What? So What? Now What?): Uses three guiding questions to streamline reflection((917)).
   - Example: Healthcare worker reflecting on a critical procedure using these sequential questions.

3. Kolb’s Experiential Learning Model: Emphasizes learning via cycles of experience, reflection, conceptualization, and experimentation.
   - Example: Software developer testing new coding methods after reflecting on past failures.

4. Atkins and Murphy’s Reflective Model: Focuses on challenging assumptions, exploring alternatives, evaluating outcomes, and articulating learning.
   - Example: A nurse re-examining personal biases after a patient complaint.

5. Boud’s Triangular Model: Simple cyclical interaction between experience, reflection, and learning.
   - Example: Student connecting coursework to practical internship tasks and lessons.

### Patterns

1. Sequential Stages Pattern: Reflection unfolds through identifiable conceptual steps or cycles (e.g., experience → observation → action).
   - Example: Engineer troubleshooting by methodically moving through observation, hypothesis, test, and adjustment.

2. Iterative/Cyclic Learning Pattern: Reflection is inherently repetitive, where each cycle leads to new learning and engagement with fresh experiences.
   - Example: Writer revising a manuscript multiple times through repeated feedback and personal analysis.

3. Multiperspective Exploration Pattern: Effective reflection involves considering multiple viewpoints, scrutinizing assumptions, and developing alternative explanations.
   - Example: Business leader reflecting on diverse feedback before pivoting strategy.

4. Action-Oriented Pattern: Reflection culminates in experimenting or acting upon insights instead of remaining merely contemplative.
   - Example: Innovator testing a new prototype after analyzing last iteration’s setbacks.

5. Emotional Awareness Pattern: Reflection incorporates awareness and management of emotional responses as part of the learning process.
   - Example: Social worker reflecting on stress and emotion after a difficult client interaction before planning self-care strategies.

6. Theory-Practice Integration Pattern: Reflection pairs lived experiences with formal theoretical frameworks to enrich understanding.
   - Example: Law student comparing courtroom experiences with legal theory for deeper insight.
