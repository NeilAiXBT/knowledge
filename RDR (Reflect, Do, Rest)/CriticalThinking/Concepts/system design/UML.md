### 1. Concept

UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized visual modeling language tailored for the specification, visualization, construction, and documentation of software and other complex systems, supporting communication across diverse stakeholders via diagrammatic representations of system structure and behavior((2)).

### 2. Definitions

1. General-Purpose Language  
   UML is a general-purpose graphical language for modeling systems, offering standardized notations and semantics for illustrating the design of both software and business systems((58)).  
   Example: A class diagram used to blueprint the object-oriented architecture of a banking application.

2. Standardization by OMG  
   UML is defined and maintained by the Object Management Group (OMG) and is governed by the ISO/IEC 19501 and ISO/IEC 19505 standards (UML 2.5.1 as of December 2017)((64)).  
   Example: UML 2.5.1 is the release that refines semantic rules and modular structure.

3. Integration of Methods  
   UML unifies notations from various object-oriented methods (OMT, Booch, OOSE) and introduces new constructs for wider applicability((359)).  
   Example: Use-case modeling from OOSE incorporated with static modeling from OMT.

4. Communication Language  
   UML functions as a universal specification and communication medium between technical and business participants in a system development lifecycle((204)).  
   Example: Use-case diagrams facilitating requirements negotiation between developers and clients.

### 3. Laws

1. Conformance and Constraints  
   UML’s correctness is governed by constraints and metamodel rules specified in OMG documentation, ensuring diagrams are interpretable across tools((77)).  
   Example: A class cannot inherit from itself, enforced by metamodel constraints.

2. Event-Based Communication Laws  
   Formal axiomatic approaches introduce 'event introduction', 'event communication', and 'event attribute' axioms, ensuring precise event modeling and causality in interaction diagrams((628)).  
   Example: Sequence diagrams must match send and receive message events for correctness.

3. Validity in Relationships  
   Laws dictate allowable compositions, relationships, and element interactions, such as valid multiplicity, association, and inheritance in diagrams.  
   Example: Aggregation cannot form cyclic structures (e.g., a part cannot be the whole’s ancestor).

### 4. Axioms

1. Event Introduction Axiom  
   Every event in an interaction diagram must be introduced before communication—no referencing an undefined event((628)).  
   Example: Before a message 'OrderPlaced' is sent between objects, it must be declared in the model.

2. Event Communication Axiom  
   Model communication requires explicit mapping of events between senders and receivers, ensuring causality and measurable order((628)).  
   Example: An event 'PaymentProcessed' must be received only after it is sent.

3. Event Attribute Axiom  
   Each event must carry its defined attributes consistently through the diagram, maintaining data coherence during interaction((628)).  
   Example: 'LoginEvent' must always include 'username' and 'timestamp' across statecharts.

4. Design Axioms in OO Context  
   When applying object-oriented design in UML, each class, attribute, association, or method must comply with design axioms such as single responsibility and clear inheritance((629)).  
   Example: A 'User' class should encapsulate only user-specific responsibilities, per the single responsibility principle.

### 5. Theories

1. Unification Theory  
   UML was developed by unifying three major OO methods: OMT, Booch, and OOSE, resulting in a single standard modeling language((67)).  
   Example: Bringing together use-case diagrams from OOSE and class diagrams from OMT in a coherent modeling suite.

2. Structural and Behavioral Viewpoints  
   UML is underpinned by the theory that complex systems require different views: structure (static) and behavior (dynamic)((102)).  
   Example: Structure is modeled by class diagrams, behavior by state machine diagrams.

3. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) Theory  
   UML acts as a principal modeling notation in MDE, wherein models are first-class citizens in software engineering processes((1203)).  
   Example: Automated code generation from UML class and sequence diagrams.

4. Extension and Stereotyping Theory  
   UML provides extension mechanisms (profiles and stereotypes) for domain-specific modeling((38)).  
   Example: A ‘Security’ profile stereotypes all classes with access-level requirements.

### 6. Principles

1. Choice of Model Matters  
   The model(s) selected must address specific concerns and phases (requirements, design, implementation) in system development((732)).  
   Example: Use-case diagrams for capturing requirements, component diagrams for architectural design.

2. Multiple Abstraction Levels  
   Models should be tailored in detail to stakeholder needs, from high-level concepts to implementation specifics((739)).  
   Example: Conceptual perspective in domain modeling, specification perspective for system design.

3. Models Simplify Reality  
   Each UML model provides an abstraction, focusing on salient system aspects and omitting trivialities((746)).  
   Example: Class diagrams depict only essential objects, not implementation details.

4. Complementary Models Usage  
   Complex systems require the use of several nearly independent, but interrelated models((744)).  
   Example: Sequence diagrams (for dynamic interactions) and class diagrams (for static structure) used together.

5. Clarity and Consistency  
   Diagrams must use standard UML notations and be adapted for the appropriate audience((351)).  
   Example: Non-programmer-friendly use-case diagrams for stakeholders; detailed class diagrams for developers.

### 7. Frameworks

1. Generalized UML Pattern Framework  
   A base framework offering default behavior and protocol support for implementing model patterns((1179)).  
   Example: Plug-in-based pattern composition in IBM Rational tools, using expansion behaviors for default modeling extensions.

2. Specialized UML Pattern Framework  
   Extends the generalized variant with role-marking features and manages pattern participant traceability((1191)).  
   Example: Traceability in a pattern library allows distinguishing between ‘Controller’ or 'View' participants in MVC pattern instantiation.

3. Development Process Integration (e.g., RUP)  
   UML frameworks are tightly integrated into broader development methodologies (e.g., Rational Unified Process) for model-driven cycle management((191)).  
   Example: Using UML artifacts for planning, analysis, and iterative refinement in RUP.

### 8. Models

1. Use-Case Model  
   Defines functional requirements and system scope via actors and use cases((1205)).  
   Example: In an online shopping system, use-case diagrams model ‘Place Order’, ‘View Cart’ functions.

2. Analysis Model  
   Conceptualizes domain elements and relationships, often via class diagrams((1205)).  
   Example: Class diagram showing Customer, Cart, Product (for e-commerce analysis).

3. Design Model  
   Specifies software implementation details and architectural components((1205)).  
   Example: Component diagram for microservices in a distributed application.

4. Implementation Model  
   Depicts realization of system components and artifacts using component and deployment diagrams((1205)).  
   Example: Deployment diagram illustrating server nodes and deployed WAR files in a web application.

5. Package Model  
   Organizes modeling elements into logical groups/packages for manageability((279)).  
   Example: Packages for ‘UserManagement’ and ‘Inventory’ in a retail application.

6. Structural Model  
   Shows static aspects with class, object, and composite structure diagrams((257)).  
   Example: Composite structure diagram mapping internal class components.

7. Behavioral Model  
   Captures dynamic behaviors via activity, sequence, state machine, and interaction diagrams((282)).  
   Example: State machine diagram for an order’s lifecycle.

### 9. Patterns

1. Observer Pattern  
   Establishes one-to-many dependency for automated notification upon state change((1229)).  
   Example: News feed updates all subscribers when new content is published.

2. Mediator Pattern  
   Centralizes complex object communication by routing interactions through a mediator((1230)).  
   Example: Chatroom instance brokering messages between participant objects.

3. Iterator Pattern  
   Provides a uniform method to traverse elements in a collection((1231)).  
   Example: Customer order list iterated via a standard interface.

4. Command Pattern  
   Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization and queuing((1232)).  
   Example: ‘Undo’ history in a text editor represented by command objects.

5. Chain of Responsibility Pattern  
   Lets requests pass through a sequence of handlers, each deciding to process or delegate((1233)).  
   Example: Technical support requests escalated through support tiers.

6. Proxy Pattern  
   Controls and augments access to another object, e.g., via deferred instantiation or logging((1234)).  
   Example: Virtual proxy for image objects that loads data only when accessed.

7. Composite Pattern  
   Organizes objects in tree structures for uniform treatment of individual and grouped entities((1235)).  
   Example: File system where files and directories are both handled through a common interface.

8. Bridge Pattern  
   Decouples abstraction from implementation, allowing both to vary independently((1237)).  
   Example: Shape abstraction separated from rendering logic for vector and raster graphics.

9. Builder Pattern  
   Separates construction and representation, enabling complex objects to be built stepwise((1239)).  
   Example: Building a step-by-step configuration of a meal order.

10. Decorator Pattern  
    Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects without affecting others from the same class((1241)).  
    Example: Adding scrollbars or borders to a window in a GUI system.
