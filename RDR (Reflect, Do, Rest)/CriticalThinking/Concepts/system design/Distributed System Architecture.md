### Concept

Distributed System Architecture is a paradigm where applications and services are constructed from multiple independent components (nodes) that communicate and coordinate actions over a network to achieve a shared objective, thus forming a logically unified system despite being physically separated. This architecture is central to modern solution designs, enabling high scalability, fault tolerance, and improved resource utilization by leveraging the collaboration between distinct hardware, virtual, or software nodes.

### Definitions

1. Distributed System
   - A collection of independent computational entities (e.g., computers, virtual machines, containers) that work together and coordinate to appear and operate as a single system to end users.
   - Example: A cloud-hosted e-commerce platform where database servers, web servers, and cache nodes interact to serve user requests collectively.

2. Node
   - Any device or software process that participates independently in the architecture, communicating through defined protocols while possessing its own resources and execution context.
   - Example: An application server within a microservices architecture acting as one node among many.

3. Middleware
   - The software layer that abstracts network, operating system, and hardware complexities, providing standard communication and interaction interfaces between distributed nodes.
   - Example: Apache Kafka handling asynchronous messaging between microservices.

### Laws

1. CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem)
   - States that any distributed data store can simultaneously satisfy only two of three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. In the event of a network partition, the system must trade off either consistency or availability.
   - Example: MongoDB opts for consistency and partition tolerance, accepting the possibility of unavailability during network splits; Cassandra favors availability and partition tolerance, accepting eventual consistency.

2. Amdahl’s Law
   - Addresses limits to parallel speedup, noting that the maximum system improvement is limited by the part that cannot be parallelized.
   - Example: In a distributed analytics platform, if a given workload’s serial component is 10%, the maximum speedup achievable, regardless of node count, is 10x.

### Axioms

1. The Network is Unreliable
   - Network failures (packet loss, latency spikes, outages) can occur at any time.
   - Example: Messages dropped in a distributed messaging system, causing retries or missed updates.

2. Latency is Greater than Zero
   - Communication is never instantaneous; it is limited by the speed of light and network infrastructure.
   - Example: Cross-continent service-to-service calls in a globally distributed application.

3. Bandwidth is Limited
   - Data transfer capacity is finite and subject to contention or saturation.
   - Example: Simultaneous video streams in a distributed content delivery network.

4. Security is Imperfect
   - Any open network is vulnerable to malware, interception, and unauthorized access.
   - Example: Intrusion into distributed IoT sensor networks without proper encryption.

5. Topology is Dynamic
   - Nodes can join, leave, or change location unpredictably.
   - Example: Mobile devices connecting and disconnecting from a distributed health monitoring system.

6. Administrative Autonomy
   - Multiple administrative domains act independently, yielding policy conflicts or connectivity issues.
   - Example: Firewall changes in one domain disrupting access to shared distributed cloud resources.

7. Transport Cost Greater than Zero
   - Both communication and network deployment incur overheads.
   - Example: Serialization and transmission of large files in distributed storage solutions.

8. Network Heterogeneity
   - Networks encompass a variety of technologies, protocols, and data formats.
   - Example: Distributed financial systems interacting across mixed legacy and modern components.

### Theories

1. Consistency Models
   - Describe how system state changes are observed by different nodes:
     - Strong Consistency: All nodes reflect the latest updates instantly.
       - Example: Relational databases requiring immediate ordering of financial transactions.
     - Eventual Consistency: Updates propagate over time; all nodes will eventually synchronize.
       - Example: NoSQL databases like Cassandra providing eventual consistency options.
     - Causal Consistency: Operations that are causally related are kept in order.
       - Example: Distributed social networks showing consistent timelines.

2. Fault Tolerance Theory
   - Systems remain functional even as components fail, often through redundancy and replication.
   - Example: Replicated microservices in multiple data centers for continuous application availability.

3. Distributed Consensus
   - Mechanisms (e.g., Paxos, Raft) establishing agreement among nodes despite failures.
   - Example: Raft protocol used by Kubernetes for controlling leader election and configuration state.

4. Load Balancing and Scalability Theories
   - Evenly distribute work among nodes to optimize performance.
   - Example: Using load balancers to distribute web traffic across redundant servers.

### Principles

1. Decentralization
   - Distributing control and decision-making across the system, preventing a single point of failure.
   - Example: Peer-to-peer file sharing.

2. Scalability
   - System should grow without major redesign, either by adding more nodes (horizontal) or improving node capacity (vertical).
   - Example: Cloud-native platforms scaling out web servers to accommodate more users.

3. Fault Tolerance
   - Systems continue to function amid partial failures.
   - Example: Payment systems switching to backup nodes during hardware failures.

4. Transparency
   - Hide complexities (location, replication, failures) from users and developers.
   - Example: Distributed databases abstracting sharding from client applications.

5. Resource Sharing
   - Nodes share computational, storage, and network resources.
   - Example: Distributed caches accessed by multiple microservices.

6. Performance Optimization
   - Take measures such as caching, asynchronous communication, and data partitioning to improve efficiency.
   - Example: CDN caches for fast multimedia delivery.

7. Security and Trust
   - Secure communication and verified identities across networked nodes.
   - Example: TLS-encrypted public key authentication in distributed message brokers.

### Frameworks

1. Software Architectures
   - Layered Architecture: Organizes system into hierarchical functional layers((1098)).
     - Example: OSI network model.
   - Object-based Architecture: Components interact via method calls or APIs.
     - Example: Java RMI-enabled distributed applications.
   - Data-Centered Architecture: Central data repository accessed by multiple components((1156)).
     - Example: Shared relational databases.

2. System Architectures
   - Client-Server Framework: Clients request, servers provide, possibly with tiering.
     - Example: Web browser (client) and web server (server).
   - Peer-to-Peer Framework: All nodes serve as both clients and servers.
     - Example: BitTorrent.

3. Middleware and Orchestration
   - Abstracts and manages interaction, state, and failure handling among distributed components.
     - Example: Kubernetes for container orchestration.

### Models

1. Client-Server Model
   - Clients initiate requests; servers process and provide results.
   - Example: RESTful API architecture.

2. Peer-to-Peer Model
   - Each node can act as both a server and a client, sharing data equally.
   - Example: Blockchain networks.

3. Layered Model
   - Distinct layers, where each layer only interacts with adjacent ones.
   - Example: Multi-layer enterprise applications.

4. Multi-Tier (n-Tier) Model
   - Expands layered architecture by adding or specializing tiers for separation of presentation, logic, and data.
   - Example: Three-tier e-commerce applications with UI, business logic, and data tiers.

### Patterns

1. Microservices Pattern
   - Application is decomposed into independent, loosely coupled services, each owning its own data and business logic.
   - Example: Netflix decomposing streaming, recommendations, billing, and content delivery into individually deployable services.

2. Event-Driven Pattern
   - Components communicate by emitting and responding to events, often asynchronously.
   - Example: Real-time messaging apps using publish-subscribe systems.

3. Master-Slave (Leader-Follower) Pattern
   - Master orchestrates and slaves execute/replicate tasks, often used for data replication and redundancy.
   - Example: Database clusters with one master handling writes and multiple replicas handling reads.

4. Circuit Breaker Pattern
   - Detects failures and prevents failure propagation by blocking or redirecting requests during outages.
   - Example: Microservice fallback strategies.

5. Load Balancing Pattern
   - Even distribution of workload among available nodes to optimize resource and response time.
   - Example: HTTP load balancers for web servers.
