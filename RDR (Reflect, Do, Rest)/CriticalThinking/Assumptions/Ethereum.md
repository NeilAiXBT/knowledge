### Value Assumptions about Ethereum

1. **Decentralization Is Intrinsically Valuable:** It is assumed that the highest value of Ethereum stems from operating as a censorship-resistant, open platform where users trust the protocol and its cryptographic foundation rather than centralized intermediaries, facilitating open participation and innovation.
2. **Security Is Paramount:** Ethereum’s security is seen as vital for network trust, user position safety, and adoption by both individuals and institutions.
3. **Innovation and Adaptability Are Prioritized:** The platform is valued for its adaptability and suitability to support new forms of economic activity such as DeFi, tokenization, and digital identity.
4. **Sustainability of the Economic Model:** There is a strong belief in the necessity of an economic model that incorporates mechanisms such as ETH fee burning and staking yields to support long-term value appreciation and the health of the network.
5. **Balance of Scalability, Security, and Decentralization:** The community perceives the need to maintain an optimal balance among scalability, decentralization, and security, reflecting the importance of robustness and capacity for future growth.
6. **Network Effects and Community:** The aggregate value of Ethereum is closely associated with the vibrancy of its developer community, ecosystem diversity, and the breadth of use cases, all of which reinforce adoption and trust.
7. **Composability and Interoperability:** Valuing the seamless integration between decentralized applications, composability is critical for cultivating an innovative protocol economy.

### Prescriptive Assumptions about Ethereum

1. **Maximize Decentralization:** Ethereum should strive for maximal decentralization in governance and network operations, reinforcing its permissionless and censorship-resistant qualities.
2. **Prioritize Scalability and Efficiency:** The network ought to implement scalability solutions such as sharding and Layer 2 rollups in order to support increased demand without undermining foundational principles.
3. **Ensure Open and Transparent Upgrades:** Protocol upgrades must be governed by transparent, inclusive processes balancing innovation, backward compatibility, and safety.
4. **Adopt Economic Models Favoring Staking and Deflation:** Ethereum's economic design should feature deflationary mechanisms (like EIP-1559) and staking as key tools for enhancing ETH's function as both a store of value and yield asset.
5. **Preserve or Enhance User Experience and Sustainability:** Any proposed feature or protocol change should at least maintain, if not improve, the user experience while ensuring economic sustainability.
6. **Mandate Unconditional User Privacy:** Privacy functionalities should be developed in an unconditional, user-centric way, providing clear mental models and avoiding false perceptions of security.
7. **Rely on Off-chain Governance for Protocol Evolution:** Ethereum’s governance process should continue to rely significantly on off-chain mechanisms (core dev meetings, Github, community calls) for coordination and protocol changes.
8. **Economic Incentives for Honest Validators:** Validators under Proof-of-Stake must be economically incentivized through rewards and slashing mechanisms, ensuring rational actors prioritize network integrity.

### Descriptive Assumptions about Ethereum

1. **General-purpose Smart Contract Platform:** Ethereum is a decentralized, global platform hosting a large and active developer and user community, commonly described as a “world computer”.
2. **Smart Contract Execution via EVM:** The network executes programs (smart contracts) using the Ethereum Virtual Machine, with deterministic state transitions recorded on-chain.
3. **Proof-of-Stake Consensus Security:** Ethereum currently uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus where validators stake ETH for rewards and to maintain security, with penalties for malicious actions.
4. **Variable and Dynamically Adjusted ETH Supply:** Ether supply is not fixed but is dynamically adjusted based on factors such as staking participation and fee burning; it can be inflationary or deflationary.
5. **High Security and Resilience:** The protocol’s decentralization, geographically distributed nodes, and client diversity contribute to both security and resilience.
6. **Wide Applicability and Ecosystem Breadth:** Ethereum underpins a diverse ecosystem of financial (DeFi) and non-financial applications, from NFTs to supply chain tracking and decentralized governance.
7. **Layer 2 Scalability:** Solutions such as Layer 2 rollups are recognized as essential for enhancing throughput and reducing costs, supporting wider application growth.
8. **Strong Network Effects:** Ethereum’s large developer base and deep liquidity are assumed to sustain its leadership position and ecosystem growth trajectory.
9. **Major Upgrades and Evolving Incentives:** Transitions such as the move from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake significantly lowered energy consumption and transformed incentive structures.

### Paradigmatic Assumptions about Ethereum

1. **Decentralization as a Paradigm Shift:** It assumes that decentralized, open networks fundamentally transform finance, governance, and digital ownership by fostering transparency and resistance to centralized abuses.
2. **Programmability Establishes Trust:** Trust and intermediation can be replaced by protocol-enforced, programmable logic, consensus, and cryptography, enabling new forms of credible public infrastructure.
3. **Open-source Innovation Is Superior:** Open-source, collaborative development is held as the best path for sustained innovation and robust public digital infrastructure, surpassing closed and proprietary systems.
4. **Singleton World-State as Unifying Principle:** The core design models a unified, singular state machine ("world computer"), facilitating composability and economic activity at global scale.
5. **Composability and Ecosystem Synergy:** A core belief is that inter-operability between decentralized applications (composability) generates powerful network effects and fosters innovation.
6. **Credible Neutrality Is Essential:** System “neutrality”—allowing anyone to build openly—is a prerequisite for Ethereum’s long-term strength and social legitimacy.
7. **Technological Evolution Can Solve Blockchain Trilemmas:** There is faith that continuing technological advancement will enable Ethereum to solve the so-called “scalability trilemma” (scaling, security, decentralization).
8. **Economic Incentives Align Security with Decentralization:** The paradigm assumes appropriately designed rewards and penalties will keep validator interests aligned with honest, decentralized protocol operation.

### Causal Assumptions about Ethereum

1. **Transaction Fees Affect Processing Speed:** Higher transaction fees (gas prices) directly incentivize validators to prioritize and process transactions more quickly.
2. **Network Activity Raises Fees and Congestion:** Expanded usage and transaction volume drive up gas prices and can lead to network congestion, affecting both processing time and user experience.
3. **Relative Gas Price Is Decisive for Inclusion:** The competitiveness of a transaction’s gas price relative to recent blocks strongly influences its processing speed.
4. **Pending Low-fee Transactions Delay Inclusion:** If a sender has outstanding low-fee transactions, it can cause significant delays in the processing of their subsequent transfers.
5. **Smart Contract Complexity Increases Execution Time:** More complex or larger smart contracts result in higher gas requirements and potentially slower execution.
6. **Protocol Upgrades Drive Economic and Security Outcomes:** Upgrades such as the shift to PoS are believed to causally improve network energy efficiency, security, foster deflationary pressure, and bolster Ethereum’s appeal to both ESG-minded and financial investors.
7. **External Events Impact Pricing and Fees:** Regulatory changes, speculation, or significant global events can influence transaction costs and network conditions through user gas pricing behavior.
8. **Validator and User Behavior Influence Efficiency:** Validators’ honest participation and users’ choices in fee-setting directly affect transaction throughput and network reliability.

### Explicit Assumptions about Ethereum

1. **Hardcoded Gas Limits Prevent Reentrancy:** The protocol explicitly relies on specific gas limits (such as the 2300 gas limit when sending ETH to a contract) to prevent reentrancy vulnerabilities, recognizing that parameter changes directly affect contract security.
2. **Separation of Architecture Layers:** The Ethereum client architecture is designed with explicit modular separation—distinct roles for execution, consensus, and data layers, along with validator responsibilities and minimum stake (e.g., 32 ETH).
3. **Validator Rewards and Slashing Are Defined:** Validators’ incentives (rewards for honest actions, slashing for misbehavior) are clearly laid out and constitute central security mechanisms.
4. **Transparent Upgrade Process:** Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) must follow an explicit and transparent review and acceptance process, overseen by independent editors and the core dev community.
5. **Base Fee Burning and Staking Mechanics:** EIP-1559’s base fee burning and staking rewards are specified as protocol mechanisms for value stabilization and network security.
6. **Deterministic EVM Operation:** Operation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as a deterministic, global state machine is a formally articulated assumption supporting consistent network computation.
7. **Proof-of-Stake Lowers Energy Use:** Ethereum’s explicit upgrade path targets drastic energy use reduction and improved inclusivity through the transition to PoS consensus.

### Implicit Assumptions about Ethereum

1. **Economic Incentives Are Sufficient for Honesty:** Trust in validators and participants is underpinned by implicit belief that economic rewards and slashing alone will motivate correct behavior, obviating the need for traditional trust in people or institutions.
2. **Off-chain Governance Will Sustain Effective Upgrades:** The community implicitly assumes that consensus and coordination via informal, off-chain mechanisms (developer calls, forums) can reliably deliver smooth and safe protocol upgrades.
3. **Ecosystem Growth Is Self-reinforcing:** Sustained growth in developer engagement, applications, and integrations is expected to maintain and reinforce Ethereum’s long-term dominance.
4. **Layer 2 Solutions Will Scale as Needed:** It is taken for granted that rollups and other scaling solutions will scale adequately and defer core scaling limits without undermining network security or decentralization.
5. **Regulatory Hurdles Are Manageable:** There is an implicit expectation that regulatory developments will not present insurmountable obstacles impeding protocol use or retroactively threatening network participants.

### Background Assumptions about Ethereum

1. **A Native Token (ETH) Is Essential:** The protocol presupposes that a native unit of account and fuel for operation (ETH) is required for transaction fees and validator incentives.
2. **Network Effects Ensure Adoption and Resilience:** There is a foundational, often unexamined belief that large-scale developer and user engagement automatically ensures security, utility, and staying power.
3. **Cryptographic Consensus Surpasses Centralized Security:** Consensus, transparency, and cryptographic proofs are believed to provide fundamentally superior security and reliability compared to centralized alternatives.
4. **Technological Progress Will Uphold Decentralization:** It’s generally assumed that as protocol complexity increases, Ethereum will adapt while remaining open and credibly neutral.
5. **Coordination and Governance Will Endure Complexity:** The community is expected to continue effectively coordinating and evolving governance even as both on-chain and off-chain complexity rises.
6. **Economic Structures Will Maintain Honest Participation:** The belief persists that staking, slashing, and dynamic fee mechanisms will be sufficient to continually incentivize validator honesty and secure network operation.
7. **Scalability Through Layer 2 Is Feasible Without Security Loss:** The network assumes compatibility and security are preserved as Layer 2 scaling solutions proliferate.
8. **Long-term User Demand Is Sustainable:** DeFi, NFT, and dApp proliferation will continue to drive robust demand for Ethereum blockspace and ETH utility.
9. **The Regulatory Environment Will Not Severely Impede Evolution:** Continued protocol development is presumed to remain largely unhampered by legal or policy shifts.
