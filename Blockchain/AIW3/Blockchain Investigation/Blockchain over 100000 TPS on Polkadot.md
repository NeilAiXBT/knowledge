### Blockchains in the Polkadot Ecosystem Achieving Over 100,000 TPS

The Polkadot ecosystem and its canary network, Kusama, have demonstrated the capability to achieve high transaction throughputs, with some projects built on the Polkadot SDK reaching or exceeding 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) in testing environments. The Polkadot SDK, also known as Substrate, provides a flexible framework for blockchain development.

#### Kusama Network Stress Tests
Kusama, an experimental environment designed to test the limits of the Polkadot technology, has undergone "Spammening" stress tests to evaluate its performance under heavy load.

-   **First Spammening Test**: In a test conducted in the week leading up to December 5, 2024, Kusama achieved a solid 82,000 batch transactions TPS using 15 cores. This was a significant achievement for a live network that operates with real value.
-   **Second Spammening Test**: A subsequent live-streamed test on December 4, 2024, pushed Kusama even further, achieving **128,184 TPS** using 23 allocated cores. This test involved over 30,000 participants actively submitting transactions. The network remained stable during this peak load, with only a slight increase in finality time to 18 seconds. Polkadot has also recorded a sustained rate of **143,343 TPS**.

These tests showcased the network's resilience and its ability to handle far more transactions than initially anticipated, demonstrating the true capabilities of Polkadot's underlying technology. The theoretical maximum TPS for the Polkadot Ecosystem is 100,000 transactions per second.

#### Aleph Zero
Aleph Zero, another blockchain built with the Substrate development framework that powers Polkadot, has achieved 100,000 TPS with 1-second finality.

#### Polkadot's Overall Capacity
Polkadot's architecture is designed as a sharded, multi-chain network where the relay chain provides security for various parachains (rollup chains). These parachains rely on Polkadot's computational resources to process transactions. The relay chain itself is not designed for direct transaction processing, with plans to reduce its transaction count to zero.

Polkadot's current design allows for a theoretical throughput of over 623,000 TPS at 100% capacity. With future advancements like JAM, the potential transaction capacity could scale to millions of TPS. This horizontal scaling approach, utilizing multiple cores, is considered the way to achieve high scalability in blockchain networks. Polkadot also aims to exceed 100,000 TPS post its V1 upgrade, with transaction costs around $0.00025.
