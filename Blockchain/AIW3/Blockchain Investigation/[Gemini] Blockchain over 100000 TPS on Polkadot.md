### Blockchains Built with Polkadot SDK Achieving Over 100,000 TPS

#### Kusama
- Kusama, an experimental network built with the Polkadot SDK, has demonstrated live stress test speeds of 128,184 transactions per second (TPS), surpassing the 100,000 TPS mark in testing.
- The max theoretical throughput for Kusama's architecture is cited as 100,000 TPS, with potential to exceed 623,000 TPS when utilizing all available cores.
- Kusama’s results are based on real-world stress tests rather than only theoretical numbers, showcasing robust scalability in practice.

#### Aleph Zero
- Aleph Zero, also built using the Polkadot SDK (Substrate), has achieved benchmarks of up to 100,000 simulated TPS, with some sources citing validation times for 89,600 TPS and more recent references mentioning 100,000+ TPS in testing environments.
- Aleph Zero’s architecture allows fast transaction finalization and demonstrates high throughput on a consistent basis in test environments.

### Notes on Other Projects

- Humanode is another blockchain built with the Polkadot SDK but there are no publicly available metrics showing it has surpassed the 100,000 TPS benchmark.
- While there are over 150 blockchains built using the Polkadot SDK, Kusama and Aleph Zero are currently the only ones with published results meeting or exceeding 100,000 TPS.

### Summary Table

| Blockchain  | Built with Polkadot SDK | TPS Achieved                | TPS Context         |
|-------------|:----------------------:|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| Kusama      | Yes                    | 128,184 (live), 100,000+    | Stress Test         |
| Aleph Zero  | Yes                    | 100,000+ (simulated/test)   | Test Environment    |

Both Kusama and Aleph Zero stand out as high-throughput blockchains built on the Polkadot SDK that have publicly demonstrated transaction speeds over 100,000 TPS.
