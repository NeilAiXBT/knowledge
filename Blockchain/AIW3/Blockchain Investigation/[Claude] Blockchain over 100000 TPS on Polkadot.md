List all Blockchains with over 100000 TPS that built with Polkadot SDK

### Blockchains Built with Polkadot SDK Achieving Over 100,000 TPS

Based on the available data, there are currently two blockchains built with the Polkadot SDK that have demonstrated transaction speeds exceeding 100,000 TPS:

### Kusama

Kusama, Polkadot's canary network, has achieved the highest recorded TPS among Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. During stress testing events called "Spammening," Kusama demonstrated exceptional performance:

- **128,184 TPS**: Achieved during a live-streamed stress test on December 4, 2024, using only 23 of its 100 available cores
- **143,343 TPS**: The highest recorded peak throughput during community testing, utilizing only 23% of available network capacity
- **623,230 TPS**: Theoretical maximum throughput if all 100 cores were utilized at full capacity

These tests were conducted on a live production network with real value, not in a controlled testnet environment. Kusama's architecture allows for elastic scaling, where multiple cores can be allocated dynamically to handle increased transaction loads.

### Aleph Zero

Aleph Zero is a privacy-focused Layer 1 blockchain built using the Polkadot SDK (Substrate framework) that has achieved significant TPS benchmarks:

- **100,000 TPS**: Achieved in testing environments with sub-second finality
- **89,600 TPS**: Recorded during a 2021 test involving 112 nodes across 5 continents, with validation times of 416 milliseconds

Aleph Zero utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) combined with the AlephBFT consensus protocol to achieve these high throughput levels while maintaining privacy features through zero-knowledge proofs.

### Summary Table

| Blockchain | Built with Polkadot SDK | Peak TPS Achieved | Testing Environment |
|------------|:----------------------:|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Kusama** | ✓ | 143,343 | Live production network |
| **Aleph Zero** | ✓ | 100,000 | Test environment |

### Additional Context

While the Polkadot SDK has been used to build over 150 blockchain projects, Kusama and Aleph Zero are currently the only two with publicly documented performance metrics exceeding 100,000 TPS. Other blockchains built with the Polkadot SDK may have the technical capability to achieve similar speeds but have not yet published benchmark results demonstrating this level of performance.

It's important to note that Polkadot itself, as the main relay chain, has a theoretical maximum TPS of 100,000 and aims to scale even further with future upgrades like JAM, potentially reaching millions of TPS.
