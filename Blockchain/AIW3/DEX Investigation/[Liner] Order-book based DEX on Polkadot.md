### Order-Book Based DEX Blockchains on Polkadot Ecosystem

Several decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are built on the Polkadot SDK and within its ecosystem, focusing on order-book models to offer a trading experience similar to centralized exchanges while maintaining decentralization.

#### Polkadex
Polkadex is an open-source, decentralized exchange platform built using the Substrate Blockchain Framework, offering a centralized user experience. It aims to provide a fully decentralized environment for peer-to-peer token exchange, supporting high-frequency trading and trading bots. The platform also features cross-chain compatibility, allowing traders to bring liquidity from other blockchains like Ethereum via ChainBridge protocol. Polkadex Orderbook, a key innovation, combines features of both DEX and CEX, is non-custodial, and supports multi-chain assets.

*   **TPS Information**:
    *   The Polkadex Orderbook is capable of handling up to approximately 500,000 transactions per second with low latency.
    *   In its testnet phase, Polkadex could reach speeds of 300 transactions per second (tps).
    *   The block time of 3 seconds, provided by the Babe/Grandpa consensus algorithm, allows transaction speeds of up to 400 transactions per second under test conditions.

*   **GitHub Repositories**:
    *   **Polkadex Substrate**: https://github.com/Polkadex-Substrate/Polkadex
    *   **Polkadex-Orderbook-Frontend**: https://github.com/Polkadex-Substrate/Polkadex-Orderbook-Frontend
    *   **Polkadex Orderbook Examples**: https://github.com/Polkadex-Substrate/polkadex-orderbook-examples
    *   **Polkadex-Substrate (Organization)**: https://github.com/polkadex-substrate

#### Polkaswap
Polkaswap is a cross-chain Decentralized Exchange (DEX) aggregator designed for swapping tokens within Polkadot and from other ecosystems via bridges. It functions as a non-custodial Automated Market Maker (AMM)-DEX protocol specifically crafted for the Polkadot and Kusama networks. Polkaswap recently launched a 100% decentralized on-chain order book, where all orders and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, promoting transparency, security, and non-custodial operations.

*   **TPS Information**:
    *   Polkaswap is capable of handling up to 20,000 transactions per second (tps).

*   **GitHub Repositories**:
    *   **DEX Manager Pallet**: https://github.com/sora-xor/sora2-network/tree/master/pallets/dex-manager
    *   **Orderbook Pallet**: https://github.com/sora-xor/sora2-network/tree/master/pallets/order-book
    *   **Multicollateral Bonding Curve Pool Pallet**: https://github.com/sora-xor/sora2-network/tree/master/pallets/multicollateral-bonding-curve-pool
    *   **Pool XY=K Pallet**: https://github.com/sora-xor/sora2-network/tree/master/pallets/pool-xyk
    *   **Trading Pair Pallet**: https://github.com/sora-xor/sora2-network/tree/master/pallets/trading-pair

#### Other Order-Book Based DEX Projects
While specific TPS metrics and dedicated GitHub links for order-book functionality were not consistently detailed for all, these projects are also recognized within the Polkadot ecosystem for their DEX capabilities:

*   **Zenlink**: Zenlink is a cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol aiming to be a central hub for DEX composability and seamless liquidity sharing among parachains within the Polkadot ecosystem. It offers a pluggable DEX module that allows parachains to quickly gain DEX capabilities and share liquidity across the network.

*   **HydraDX (now Hydration)**: HydraDX is a DEX parachain on Polkadot that features a unique Automated Market Maker, Omnipool, which combines all assets into a single trading pool to prevent liquidity fragmentation.

*   **Equilibrium**: Equilibrium combines a money market with an order book-based DEX.
