### Competitor Analysis and Comparisons

#### General Comparisons of DEXs on Aleph Zero
All DEXs built on Aleph Zero share key features such as lightning-fast transaction speeds, robust privacy through zero-knowledge proofs, and modular smart contract support. They are designed to offer low-cost, secure, and decentralized trading experiences. The Aleph Zero blockchain itself aims to address critical challenges in scalability, security, privacy, and user/developer experience that hinder widespread adoption of blockchain technologies. AndromedaSwap, PanoramaSwap, and Camelot are all AMM-based DEXs, while Common operates primarily as an order book DEX.

#### Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) vs. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)
Common's whitepaper authors analyzed CEXs and DEXs based on price efficiency, privacy, and custody.

| Feature | Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) | Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Price Efficiency** | - Excellent due to ample liquidity.<br>- Fees are generally not large. | - Liquidity is generally not as good as CEXs.<br>- Threats related to MEV bots and front-running, especially for large trades.<br>- Smaller trades often get better rates; large orders depend on DEX liquidity.<br>- Order-book DEXs have lower overall liquidity than AMMs. |
| **Privacy** | - Good enough for many users as transactions are visible only to the exchange.<br>- Requires trust that the exchange will not counter-trade using order information. | - Non-existent on-chain, as all user actions and transaction history are public. This is critical for institutional users who need to maintain their edge. Most decentralized exchanges do not require identity verification (KYC), allowing anonymous trading. |
| **Custody** | - Requires users to use the exchange's custody over their assets.<br>- Involves trusting the platform with asset security. | - Users have full control over their assets, not relying on any third-party custodian. |
| **Large Trades** | - Traders typically place limit orders, which will eventually be filled even if immediate liquidity is low. | - Large trades are visible in the mempool, making them targets for profit extraction by specialized actors.<br>- DEXs may struggle to provide favorable prices due to insufficient liquidity for large orders.<br>- Slippage becomes a significant concern. |
| **KYC Requirements** | - Mandatory KYC procedures; users must verify their identity. | - Typically no KYC required; users can trade anonymously. |
| **Fiat Integration** | - Extensive; supports fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat transactions. | - Limited; primarily crypto-to-crypto trading. |
| **Trading Model** | - Traditional order books managed by the exchange. | - Automated Market Maker (AMM) or on-chain order books. |
| **Fees** | - May have higher trading fees; often includes deposit and withdrawal fees. | - Generally lower trading fees; users pay network (gas) fees. |
| **Security** | - Higher risk due to centralized custody; exchanges may be targets for hackers. | - Reduced risk of centralized hacks; users are responsible for their own security. Security depends heavily on the reliability of underlying smart contracts. |
| **User Experience** | - User-friendly interfaces; suitable for beginners. | - May be complex for beginners; requires understanding of wallets and blockchain. |
| **Token Availability** | - Limited to tokens vetted and listed by the exchange. | - Wide range, including new and experimental tokens. |

In summary, DEXs offer decentralization and transparency but face challenges with liquidity and MEV, whereas CEXs provide greater liquidity assurance and convenience but require users to trust the platform. The choice depends on individual priorities, risk tolerance, and trading objectives. Common aims to bridge this gap by offering privacy and efficiency within a decentralized framework.

#### Aleph Zero's Technological Advantages for DEXs
Aleph Zero addresses the 'Blockchain Trilemma' (decentralization, security, scalability) through its unique architecture.
- **Speed and Scalability**: Aleph Zero leverages its AlephBFT consensus protocol, which is a hybrid of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This allows for faster transaction speeds, higher throughput, and substantially lower transaction fees. In lab tests, AlephBFT achieved 89,600 transactions per second with a 416-millisecond validation time.
- **Security**: Aleph Zero's AlephBFT protocol offers robust security by tolerating up to 33% malicious committee members and ensuring network asynchronicity. It uses rotating committees to enhance decentralization and resilience against attacks.
- **Privacy**: Aleph Zero integrates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-SNARKs) and Secure Multi-Party Computation (sMPC) through its Liminal privacy layer. This enables private computations on user data and supports private multi-user interactions, which is crucial for DeFi protocols.
- **MEV Mitigation**: Aleph Zero addresses the MEV problem through its Liminal framework and "submarine sends," where transactions are encrypted and ordered immediately but revealed to validators only after a set period, preventing manipulation. This innovative approach enhances fairness and transparency.
