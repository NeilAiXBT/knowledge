List all DEXs built with Aleph Zero technology/blockchain, clarifying their core components, key functions, core features, architecture, advantages, and disadvantages, with necessary comparisons.

Fri Jul 11 2025

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) built on the Aleph Zero blockchain, such as Panorama Swap, Camelot, and Common DEX, leverage its high-performance, privacy-enhancing, and scalable architecture to provide secure, efficient, and user-friendly decentralized trading experiences. These platforms utilize the blockchain's features for speed, security, and privacy.

### Panorama Swap
Panorama Swap is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) decentralized exchange built on Aleph Zero, prioritizing simplicity, user experience, security, and low fees. Its design enables lightning-fast asset swapping due to Aleph Zero's sub-second block confirmation time.

#### Core Components and Architecture
Panorama Swap operates entirely through on-chain smart contract logic, making it decentralized and permissionless. Its architecture integrates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with Aleph Zero's consensus protocol to achieve sub-second finality and low fees. The platform's privacy layer is based on zero-knowledge proofs and other cryptographic techniques to protect user data and transactions.

#### Key Functions and Core Features
Panorama Swap facilitates fast, secure, and permissionless asset swapping. It allows users to provide liquidity and create liquidity pools without needing centralized approval. The primary utility token within the Panorama ecosystem is $PANX, used for orchestrating and voting on governance proposals, as well as for staking to earn yield. Its core features include lightning-fast transactions, low fees, and a user-friendly interface that maintains full custody of assets.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages
Panorama Swap offers ultra-low latency and rapid transaction confirmations due to Aleph Zero’s hybrid consensus and DAG-based architecture. It also provides a privacy-preserving design that protects user data and transaction details using zero-knowledge proofs and secure multi-party computation. A notable disadvantage of Panorama Swap is its reliance on a single, centralized liquidity pool, which can lead to imbalances and price slippage, making the system vulnerable to manipulation and market shocks.

### Camelot
Camelot, originally a prominent DEX on Arbitrum, has launched on Aleph Zero EVM. This integration signifies a crucial advancement for decentralized finance within the Aleph Zero ecosystem.

#### Core Components and Architecture
Camelot's architecture combines the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model with a concentrated liquidity variant (Camelot V3), allowing traders to supply liquidity within specific price ranges for improved capital efficiency. Operating on Aleph Zero's framework, Camelot benefits from the blockchain's rapid transaction finality, enhanced privacy features, and secure consensus mechanisms.

#### Key Functions and Core Features
Camelot supports both V2 and V3 models to cater to various trading experiences. Camelot V2 offers traditional AMM swaps and farming, while Camelot V3 introduces concentrated liquidity, allowing users to supply liquidity within a selected price range for improved capital efficiency. The integration of Camelot enables token trading on Aleph Zero EVM and will soon offer additional yield from pools and farms. Camelot will also serve as the swap engine for the upcoming Common mobile app and its browser extension.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages
Camelot offers traditional AMM functionality in V2 and V3’s concentrated liquidity feature for optimized capital efficiency and yield. It also integrates with Aleph Zero’s privacy layer, enabling secure, private token trading with high-speed transactions and low fees. However, Camelot inherits typical AMM issues such as exposure to impermanent loss and potential vulnerabilities in concentrated liquidity models, which can impact user returns and stability.

### Common DEX
Common is a privacy-focused order book exchange that blends secure, private trading with regulatory compliance. It aims to provide optimal asset prices and full user custody.

#### Core Components and Architecture
Common DEX is built on Aleph Zero’s zkOS, a framework for interchain privacy that enables developers to create privacy-enhanced, secure, and user-friendly applications. Its architecture includes an innovative order matching system integrated with shielded token pools and advanced cryptographic techniques like zk-SNARKs to conceal order details. Common DEX separates interactions with the anonymity pool and the execution engine, allowing users to interact directly with the execution engine. Privacy is an opt-in feature, allowing public order submissions.

#### Key Functions and Core Features
Common offers on-chain privacy features, innovative liquidity collection, and compatibility-focused features to enhance user experience. It uses a two-stage order matching process: internal liquidity matching followed by a permissionless Dutch Auction to reduce Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) and enhance price efficiency. Common also supports multichain trading through its bridging infrastructure and provides institutional features like compliance-first front-ends and detailed reporting.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages
Common provides superior privacy, efficient price discovery, and robust security measures that help mitigate MEV risks. It is designed to be user-friendly, offering a CEX-like experience on a DEX. The emphasis on privacy and compliance can introduce complexities in real-time order matching and execution, potentially affecting overall liquidity and user experience. Additionally, its reliance on advanced cryptographic methods may result in a steeper learning curve.
