When should permissioned blockchain be used, and when permissionless?

Sat Jun 28 2025

### Access
- **Permissioned Blockchains**: Access and participation are controlled, requiring permission or approval from a governing authority or administrator. Users can only perform specific actions granted by ledger administrators, and they must identify themselves digitally or through certificates. This means permissioned blockchains are not publicly accessible and restrict participation to designated entities.
- **Permissionless Blockchains**: These are open and decentralized networks where anyone can join, validate transactions, and participate without needing special permission. Anyone can read, write data, or participate in the consensus process.

### Decentralization
- **Permissioned Blockchains**: These blockchains have limited decentralization as they are generally used for enterprise and business purposes, which often require certain levels of centralization. They can be partially decentralized by being distributed across known participants or can even be fully centralized, offering flexibility in decentralization.
- **Permissionless Blockchains**: Built on the fundamental idea of open participation, permissionless blockchains are highly decentralized, allowing anyone to join the network. There is no central authority controlling the network, ensuring that no single entity can alter network protocols or shut down the network.

### Transparency
- **Permissioned Blockchains**: These networks offer controlled transparency based on the goals of participating organizations, meaning they do not have to provide full transparency by default. However, for business purposes, they may require more transparency at certain levels, where nodes (users and their connections) are known and their transactions are visible.
- **Permissionless Blockchains**: All transactions and activities on a permissionless blockchain are visible to the public, ensuring full transparency. While transaction amounts and addresses are usually publicly available, these blockchains provide a certain amount of anonymity for users, as wallet addresses generally cannot be traced back to individuals due to encryption methods.

### Security
- **Permissioned Blockchains**: These blockchains can offer a higher degree of privacy and security because participation is limited and managed through an access control layer. However, their security relies on the integrity of their members, making them susceptible to manipulation.### Access

### Security
- **Permissioned Blockchains**: These blockchains can offer a higher degree of privacy and security because participation is limited and managed through an access control layer. However, their security relies on the integrity of their members, making them susceptible to manipulation. With fewer participants, there is an increased risk of corruption and collusion, and consensus can be more easily overridden by network operators. Furthermore, having fewer validators can make them more vulnerable to malicious attacks.
- **Permissionless Blockchains**: Permissionless blockchains offer strong security because attackers cannot target a single repository, and it is difficult to corrupt a majority of the network to disrupt consensus mechanisms. This open design also resists censorship due to broad accessibility and participation across various locations and nationalities. However, the anonymity provided in permissionless blockchains opens the door for malicious actors to enter the network undetected.

### Performance & Scalability
- **Permissioned Blockchains**: These networks tend to be more efficient due to limited accessibility and fewer nodes managing transaction verification and consensus. This allows for improved performance and scalability.
- **Permissionless Blockchains**: While offering broad decentralization, permissionless blockchains can suffer from lower performance and scalability due to the computational strain that network-wide verification puts on computing resources. They are generally slower and can only authenticate a limited number of transactions within a given timeframe.

### Governance
- **Permissioned Blockchains**: In permissioned blockchains, a central authority governs the network, and decisions are made at a predefined level by members of the network. A private group typically authorizes decisions.
- **Permissionless Blockchains**: These networks operate without a central authority; governance is decentralized. They rely on a "majority" consensus protocol, meaning that any change to the blockchain requires a consensus among more than 50% of the users. These blockchains are also often open-source, developed by a community.

### Immutability
- **Permissioned Blockchains**: In a closed or permissioned network, chaining transactions cannot protect data from tampering, making the blockchain structure unhelpful for tamper-resistance and tamper-evidence. The entire blockchain can be re-calculated and replaced by an altered chain, with all blocks appearing valid again. Tampering in such networks is detectable not by chaining transactions, but by mechanisms like timestamps, digital signatures, and legally valid contracts.
- **Permissionless Blockchains**: To make the history of transactions tamper-resistant, permissionless blockchains require all blocks to be linked by their hash values and the implementation of a Sybil attack prevention mechanism, such as Proof-of-Work (PoW). Without a sufficiently difficult PoW or similar resource-consuming mechanism, the chaining of blocks alone would not make the system tamper-resistant. The network must remain open and permissionless for chaining blocks to be a meaningful protection against tampering.

### Use Cases
- **Permissioned Blockchains**: These are ideal for industries requiring control and privacy, such as finance or supply chain management. They are favored by entities that require security, identity, and role definition within the blockchain, making them popular for enterprise-level firms and business applications. Specific applications include supply chain provenance tracking, claims settlement, and identity verification.
- **Permissionless Blockchains**: These are used in scenarios that benefit from decentralization and openness, such as public cryptocurrencies. They tend to be used in applications with a strong financial component or those requiring highly decentralized blockchains, including digital asset trading, crowdfunding and donations, and distributed file storage.
