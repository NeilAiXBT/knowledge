List popular permissioned and permissionless blockchain networks, separately.

Sat Jun 28 2025

Here are some popular permissioned and permissionless blockchain networks.

### Popular Permissioned Blockchain Networks
Permissioned blockchains include those where access and participation are controlled. These networks often have gatekeepers that determine who can access, use, and govern the blockchain. They are also commonly referred to as private blockchains.

- **Quorum**: This is an open-source enterprise blockchain platform developed by JPMorgan Chase, built on Ethereum but modified for business needs, particularly in finance. It is also listed as a popular permissioned blockchain by Gemini and Rejolut.
- **R3 Corda**: Designed for businesses in finance and other industries, Corda is an open-source blockchain platform prioritizing privacy, scalability, and interoperability. It is also identified as a popular permissioned blockchain by Gemini, Rejolut, and is considered an ideal option for financial blockchain development.
- **Hyperledger Fabric**: This is a modular, permissioned blockchain framework hosted by the Linux Foundation, designed for enterprise-grade applications in various industries. It is widely used by enterprises to create private and secure blockchain solutions. IBM is a primary contributor to Hyperledger Fabric. It is also recognized as a popular permissioned blockchain by Gemini, Rejolut, and Kaleido.
- **Hyperledger (general)**: This platform is commonly used by enterprises for private and secure blockchain solutions.
- **Ripple**: Known as a large cryptocurrency, Ripple supports permission-based roles for network participants.
- **IBM Blockchain**: This platform enables modular architecture, making it suitable for many applications and allowing for a "network of networks" approach to security.
- **Multichain**: This platform allows businesses to create and manage private blockchain networks for various applications, including finance and supply chain.
- **SAP Cloud Platform Blockchain**: This is a permissioned blockchain service enabling businesses to build and deploy blockchain applications in the cloud, suitable for supply chain, finance, and healthcare industries.
- **Polymesh**: This is identified as a public permissioned blockchain where anyone can view its public state, but on-chain participation requires permission.

### Popular Permissionless Blockchain Networks
Permissionless blockchains are open and decentralized, allowing anyone to join, validate transactions, and participate in the network without needing special permission. These are also frequently called public blockchains due to their open nature.

- **Bitcoin (BTC)**: This is a prominent example of a permissionless blockchain, allowing anyone to join the network, send and receive transactions, operate a node, and participate in the consensus process. Bitcoin revolutionized online payments by enabling permissionless crypto payments. It accounts for nearly 40% of the entire cryptocurrency world's value.
- **Ethereum (ETH)**: Ethereum is another widely recognized permissionless blockchain, where users can freely participate in mining or staking without requiring approval. It is the foundation network for numerous cryptocurrencies and most NFTs. With a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $61.2 billion, Ethereum has the largest market share across all blockchains.
- **Cardano (ADA)**: Cardano is listed as an example of a popular permissionless blockchain.
- **Dogecoin (DOGE)**: Dogecoin is also identified as a popular permissionless blockchain. It handles transactions about 10 times faster than the Bitcoin blockchain.
- **Solana**: Solana is a popular permissionless blockchain known for its speed in processing transactions and lower fees compared to Ethereum.
- **Litecoin**: Litecoin is implemented on its own blockchain network and is an example of an altcoin created from a Bitcoin hard fork.
- **TRON**: TRON is another blockchain network supporting decentralized apps.
- **Monero**: The Monero blockchain emphasizes privacy, including extra features to obscure all transaction information.
- **BNB Smart Chain**: This blockchain promises to build Web3 with the most users and is suitable for game and decentralized finance apps.
- **Polygon**: Polygon is mentioned as a prominent permissionless blockchain.
- **Stellar**: Stellar is a blockchain network that supports its own cryptocurrency.
- **Avalanche**: Avalanche is considered the fastest smart-contracts platform, enabling users to quickly and inexpensively build decentralized apps.
- **EOS**: EOS is an open-source platform described as fast, flexible, scalable, and highly configurable for businesses and developers.
- **Chia**: The Chia blockchain network uses a "Nakamoto" consensus mechanism (Proof of Space and Time) that is energy-efficient.
