Can Substrate Framework and Cosmos SDK support up to 100,000 TPS?

Sat Jun 28 2025

### Throughput Capabilities of Blockchain Frameworks

#### Cosmos SDK Transaction Throughput
The Cosmos ecosystem is capable of processing up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). This throughput is significantly higher than Ethereum's 15-25 TPS. Most Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) connected chains running Tendermint, a core component of Cosmos SDK, can achieve around 10,000 TPS. For instance, dYdX, a decentralized exchange, transitioned to a standalone blockchain built with Cosmos SDK to leverage its capabilities, aiming for high throughput for orders and cancellations. Cosmos' app-specific chains operate independently, contributing to faster transaction processing while maintaining decentralization.

#### Substrate Framework Transaction Throughput
The Substrate framework's transaction throughput varies depending on the implementation and optimizations. Benchmarks have shown peak transaction throughputs of 800 TPS for general Substrate implementations. However, with specific advancements like the integration of BlockSTM (Software Transactional Memory) for parallel processing, Substrate-based solutions can achieve significantly higher performance. An implemented MVP of a 4-thread Substrate BlockSTM has already achieved over 5,000 TPS, representing a 5.6 times improvement over the original Substrate engine. Developers anticipate that by increasing the number of threads to 64, this solution could potentially reach a TPS of 100,000. This indicates that while standard Substrate might not natively support 100,000 TPS, optimized versions incorporating parallel virtual machine technologies can target such high transaction volumes.
