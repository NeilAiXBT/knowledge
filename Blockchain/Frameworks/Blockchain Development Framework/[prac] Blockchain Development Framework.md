### Definition and Core Concerns

A blockchain development framework is a set of pre-built tools, libraries, and modules that simplify the development process of blockchain-based applications, enabling developers to create decentralized applications and smart contracts without building the underlying infrastructure from scratch.  
Security is a primary concern in blockchain frameworks, focusing on protecting private keys, ensuring smart contract safety, and defending against data breaches and consensus attacks.  
Scalability is another critical concern, as many blockchains struggle to process high transaction volumes, necessitating solutions like sharding, layer-2 protocols, and rollups to enhance throughput.  
Interoperability drives frameworks to support cross-chain protocols such as Polkadot and Cosmos, enabling seamless asset and data transfers between disparate blockchain networks.  
Performance and resource optimization remain core objectives, requiring careful selection of consensus mechanisms and infrastructure parameters to balance transaction speed, decentralization, and computational costs.  
Regulatory compliance and governance add complexity to framework design, as developers must adapt to evolving legal requirements and privacy mandates across jurisdictions.  

### Development Environment and Typical Products
