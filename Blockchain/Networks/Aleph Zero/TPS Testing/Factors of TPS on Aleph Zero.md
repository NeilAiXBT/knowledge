Based on the information provided in the repository description, there are no specific metrics directly mentioned that relate to Transactions Per Second (TPS). However, we can infer some relevant aspects that could potentially impact or be related to TPS in the Aleph Zero blockchain implementation:

1. Consensus Algorithm:
   - The repository implements AlephBFT, a unique consensus algorithm focused on scalability.
   - AlephBFT replaces the default Substrate finality gadget (GRANDPA), which could potentially affect transaction processing speed.

2. Block Production:
   - The system uses Substrate's Aura (Authority Round) for block authoring.
   - The chain operates in periodic sessions, with each session consisting of 900 blocks.

3. Network Structure:
   - The implementation allows for running multiple nodes, which could influence overall network throughput.
   - The repository includes scripts for running a local blockchain network with multiple instances of Aleph Node.

4. Energy Efficiency:
   - Aleph Zero is described as focusing on energy efficiency, which might indirectly relate to transaction processing capabilities.

5. Scalability:
   - As one of the main focuses of Aleph Zero, scalability improvements could potentially lead to higher TPS.

6. Session Pallet:
   - The use of Substrate's Session pallet for managing authorities might impact the network's ability to process transactions efficiently.

7. Aggregator Protocol:
   - The implementation of an Aggregator protocol for producing multisignatures of finalized blocks could potentially affect overall system performance and, by extension, TPS.

While these aspects are not direct metrics for TPS, they are elements of the system that could influence its transaction processing capabilities. To get precise TPS-related metrics, one would likely need to perform benchmarks or analyze the system's performance during operation.
