The official documentation and package registry for `substrate-txtesttool` include its Rust documentation and its listing on crates.io.

- **Rust Documentation**: The `substrate-txtesttool` library's documentation is available on Docs.rs. This resource provides detailed information about the library's functionalities, including its use for sending transactions to a Substrate network and monitoring their status within the transaction pool.
- **Crates.io**: The `substrate-txtesttool` package is also listed on crates.io, which serves as the Rust community's package registry. This listing generally includes basic information about the crate and its versioning. Additionally, the `Cargo.toml` file in the `paritytech/polkadot-sdk` GitHub repository also references `substrate-txtesttool` with version 0.4.0.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Using `substrate-txtesttool` for TPS Testing on a Local Aleph Zero Network

`substrate-txtesttool` is designed to test and monitor transaction scenarios on Substrate-based chains. This guide will outline the general steps to use `substrate-txtesttool` for TPS testing of a local Aleph Zero network, leveraging its capabilities as a library and CLI tool.

#### 1. Set Up Your Local Aleph Zero Network
Ensure you have a local Aleph Zero network running and accessible. The `substrate-txtesttool` will need an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoint to connect to your network, typically `ws://127.0.0.1:9933` for a local setup.

#### 2. Install `substrate-txtesttool`
You can use `substrate-txtesttool` as a library within your Rust project or utilize its companion command-line interface (CLI).

- **As a Library**: Add `substrate-txtesttool` to your `Cargo.toml` file as a dependency.
- **As a CLI Tool**: Install the CLI tool, which allows for direct execution of its capabilities from the terminal.

#### 3. Configure the Test Scenario
The `substrate-txtesttool` operates by executing scenarios against the node. You can create a test scenario using `scenario::ScenarioBuilder` to define the parameters for your TPS test.

- **RPC URI**: Specify the WebSocket RPC URI of your local Aleph Zero node. For example, `ws://127.0.0.1:9933`.
- **Chain Type**: Set the chain type to `ChainType::Sub` as Aleph Zero is Substrate-based.
- **Transaction Count**: Define the number of transactions to send using `with_txs_count()`. For example, `100` transactions.
- **Send Threshold**: Set `send_threshold` to control the rate of transaction submission. An example value could be `20,000`.
- **Block Monitoring**: Enable or disable block monitoring using `with_block_monitoring()` to observe extrinsic counts.
- **Watched Transactions**: Determine whether to monitor the status and finalization of transactions using `with_watched_txs()`.
- **Account Range**: Specify the range of accounts to use for sending transactions with `with_start_id()` and `with_last_id()`.
- **Nonce Management**: Optionally configure nonce management with `with_nonce_from()` to start nonces from a specific value.

An example of setting up a scenario executor in Rust code would look like this:
```rust
// Shared Params
let send_threshold = 20_000;
let ws = "ws://127.0.0.1:9933";
let watched_txs = true;

// Setup for scenario executor
let scenario_executor = ScenarioBuilder::new()
    .with_rpc_uri(ws.to_string())
    .with_chain_type(ChainType::Sub)
    .with_block_monitoring(true)
    .with_start_id("0".to_string())
    .with_last_id(99)
    .with_nonce_from(Some(0))
    .with_txs_count(100)
    .with_watched_txs(watched_txs)
    .with_send_threshold(send_threshold);
```

#### 4. Execute the Test Scenario
Once the scenario is configured, execute it using `scenario_executor.execute().await`. This will initiate the transaction sending process and monitoring against your local Aleph Zero node.

#### 5. Monitor and Analyze Results
The `substrate-txtesttool` logs transaction events in a journal file, which is crucial for inspection and tracking dropped or invalid transactions. Analyze these logs to understand the transaction throughput, finalization rates, and any errors encountered during the TPS test. This will help you assess the performance of your local Aleph Zero network under load.
