### Understanding Consciousness: A Comprehensive Report

Consciousness is a complex and multifaceted mental phenomenon that encompasses subjective awareness, experience, and the capacity for behavioral flexibility. It is widely considered the central issue in current mind theories, despite the absence of an agreed-upon definition. While familiar to everyone, consciousness remains challenging to define precisely, even though it is easy to identify. It is the brain's function that enables awareness of internal and external stimuli, as well as thoughts regarding these subjective experiences.

### Core Elements and Components of Consciousness

Consciousness is composed of several fundamental elements and components that interact dynamically to create a unified experience.
1.  **Wakefulness (Arousal)**: This refers to the state of being awake and normally alert, which is a necessary condition for consciousness to exist but is not equivalent to it. Vigilance is most amenable to electrophysiological studies, and while sleep stages have standardized EEG correlates, comatose states do not.
2.  **Awareness**: Awareness constitutes the contents of consciousness, encompassing perceptions, cognitions, emotions, and self-awareness. It is the spiritual process of perceiving and analyzing stimuli from both the inner and external world.
3.  **Selective Attention**: This mechanism adjusts the overflowing wealth of mental contents to momentary needs, allowing for precise focus on specific information. Top-down attention, though not unitary, provides a way to interpret findings from phenomena like inattentional amnesia, change blindness, and attentional blink.
4.  **Qualia**: These are the subjective sensory qualities of conscious experience, such as the redness of red or the specific taste of wine, which are often referred to as "raw sensory feels". Qualia are considered intrinsic, private, and ineffable properties of experience, although contemporary theories may challenge some of these traditional commitments.
5.  **Self-awareness (Self-consciousness)**: This element refers to the capacity to be aware of oneself, meaning not only being aware but also aware that one is aware. It involves recognizing oneself as distinct from the environment and others and objectively perceiving oneself while maintaining a sense of subjectivity.

### Structure of Consciousness

Consciousness exhibits a complex hierarchical and integrated structure. It is not a fixed entity but a dynamic process with various kinds of order and structure within the domain of experience.
1.  **Phenomenal Structure**: This encompasses the overall organization of experience, including sensory ideas, qualities, and complex representations of time, space, cause, body, self, and the structured nature of lived reality. It involves a distinctive form of intentional and representational organization.
2.  **Self-Perspectival Organization**: Conscious experiences are modes or states of a conscious self or subject, providing a spatial, temporal, and meaningful perspective on the world. The intentional coherence of the experiential domain depends on the interdependence between the self as a perspective and the world as an integrated structure of objects.
3.  **Unity**: Conscious systems involve diverse forms of unity, including causal unities for action and control, and representational unities for integrating content at various scales. This allows diverse features from a single sense modality to combine into a representation of external objects, or for individual experiences to be embedded within a larger unified representational structure.
4.  **Dynamic Flow**: Consciousness is a dynamic process characterized by a coherent order of continuous change and self-transformation, akin to a "stream of consciousness". This self-transforming flow reflects both intentional coherence and practical self-understanding, allowing for directed generation of experiences.

### Context of Consciousness

The context of consciousness refers to the internal and external factors that influence and shape conscious experience. Consciousness is not an isolated phenomenon but is deeply intertwined with its environment and an individual's state.
1.  **Internal Context**: This includes emotional states, memories, drives, and the brain's internal representations. Consciousness allows for introspection and reflection on inner experiences, distinguishing between memories, emotions, and future plans within an "internal mind-space".
2.  **External Context**: This involves sensory inputs from the environment and the individual's relationship to the world around them. The way space is designed dramatically influences the flow of consciousness and the range of emotional states experienced. Architectural environments, whether natural or human-made, resonate with our essence and can impact our state of being.
3.  **Social and Cultural Context**: Consciousness is shaped by sociocultural influences and is not purely a biological adaptation, according to some views. Language, especially metaphorical language, plays a crucial role in developing abstract thought and expanding conscious awareness, helping people understand and express abstract ideas.

### Related Concepts, Definitions, Functions, and Purposes of Consciousness

Consciousness is an umbrella term covering a wide variety of mental phenomena with diverse meanings.
1.  **Related Concepts**:
    *   **Awareness**: Often used interchangeably with consciousness, it can also refer to the content of conscious states, distinguishing it from the overall state of consciousness itself.
    *   **Qualia**: These are the subjective, qualitative aspects of mental life, like the "redness of red".
    *   **Attention**: The process of selectively focusing on certain stimuli. Attention schema theory suggests the brain models its own attention to better monitor and control it.
    *   **Phenomenal Consciousness**: This refers to experience, defining the aspect of a state as "what it is like to be in that state".
    *   **Access Consciousness**: This describes the availability of mental state content to interact with other states and for use in guiding behavior.
    *   **Intentionality**: Conscious mental states are typically "about" things, referring to objects or having satisfaction conditions.
2.  **Definitions of Consciousness**:
    *   Consciousness is the state of being aware and able to think about one's own existence, emotions, thoughts, and relationship to the environment.
    *   It is described as a subjective, qualitative, and unified mental state that gives rise to behavioral flexibility.
    *   It also encompasses awareness of self, and the relationship to the world.
3.  **Functions of Consciousness**:
    *   **Information Processing**: Consciousness allows for the processing of information, selection of actions, prioritization, learning, adaptation to new information, and decision-making.
    *   **Identification of Neural Information**: It acts as a mechanism for identifying original information, through which it acquires meaning, enabling specific behavioral patterns.
    *   **Behavioral Flexibility**: By integrating complex information, consciousness provides resources for flexible reactions to changing life demands.
    *   **Problem Solving**: Consciousness enables tasks like mentally multiplying numbers, transforming ambiguous data into an unambiguous summary, manipulating information sequentially, and communicating it.
4.  **Purposes of Consciousness**:
    *   **Meaning and Purpose**: It is the field where meaning and purpose take their nature, constituted by intentions, values, and interests.
    *   **Intrinsic Value**: Phenomenal experience is endowed with intrinsic value, which motivates agents to act in certain ways and prefer some states over others.
    *   **Survival**: Consciousness contributes to survival by reducing information overload, storing information selectively, and planning behavior.
    *   **Unified Experience**: It acts as a "mental currency" that allows conscious agents to compare vastly different experiences in a common subject-centered space, explaining its unified nature.

### Types, Styles, and Characteristics of Consciousness

Consciousness can be categorized into various types and styles, each with distinct characteristics.
1.  **Types of Consciousness**:
    *   **Intransitive Consciousness**: Refers to a creature simply being a sentient being, capable of sensing and responding to its world.
    *   **Transitive Consciousness**: Describes a creature being conscious *of* various things, implying direction towards an object.
    *   **Self-consciousness**: Organisms that are aware that they are aware.
    *   **Phenomenal Consciousness**: Focuses on the qualitative, experiential properties often called "qualia," or "what it is like" to be in a state.
    *   **Access Consciousness (Functional Consciousness)**: Relates to a state's availability to interact with other states and the access one has to its content.
    *   **Narrative Consciousness**: Views conscious mental states as those appearing in an ongoing, serial narrative or "stream of consciousness" from a self's perspective.
    *   **Core Consciousness**: Immediate awareness of the environment and self in the present moment.
    *   **Extended Consciousness**: Incorporates memory and personal history, enabling planning and narrative self-construction.
2.  **Styles of Consciousness**:
    *   **Reflective vs. Pre-reflective States**: Reflective awareness involves deliberate focus, while pre-reflective is continuous background awareness.
    *   **Concrete vs. Abstract Modes**: Consciousness can operate focused on immediate perceptual detail or on concepts and generalizations.
    *   **Embodied Styles**: Consciousness experienced through bodily interactions and sensorimotor connections with the world.
3.  **Characteristics**:
    *   **Subjectivity**: Experiences are inherently from a first-person perspective, meaning understanding may be limited to those capable of similar experiences.
    *   **Qualitative Character**: Involves "raw feels" not restricted to sensory states but present in experiential states generally.
    *   **Unity**: Conscious systems integrate diverse features into a unified whole, whether locally (e.g., combining visual features) or broadly (e.g., an awareness of one's ongoing existence in time).
    *   **Intentionality and Transparency**: Conscious states are typically representational, being "about" things, and can exhibit transparency where one "looks through" sensory experience directly to external objects.
    *   **Selectivity**: Consciousness filters and focuses on certain stimuli, ignoring others, demonstrating precise attention.
    *   **Transience**: Conscious contents are constantly changing, reflecting a dynamic flow and self-transformation.

### Significance of Consciousness

Consciousness holds profound significance across various domains, from individual experience to scientific inquiry and philosophical debate.
1.  **Foundation of Subjective Experience**: Consciousness is fundamentally what it is "like to be" an organism, providing a subjective way the world appears from its mental or experiential viewpoint. This makes life meaningful and underpins individual experience.
2.  **Enables Adaptive Behavior**: Consciousness is not a useless epiphenomenon but a crucial, highly precise intermediate stage in the organization of behavior, enabling flexible reactions to changing life demands. It transforms incoming data into an unambiguous summary, which can be manipulated sequentially and communicated.
3.  **Epistemic Justification**: Conscious awareness is essential for knowledge acquisition and reflection. It provides a platform for integrating information and making decisions, demonstrating its functional importance.
4.  **Biological Value**: The existence of qualia itself provides important evidence that consciousness has biological value, as it represents visual properties and quantitative/qualitative information from other senses. Consciousness supports the vast flow of information through cortical networks during conscious states.
5.  **Social and Cultural Importance**: Consciousness facilitates understanding of interrelationships, allowing for a deeper grasp of reality beyond mere facts and information. It also enables self-awareness and influences social behavior.
6.  **Scientific and Medical Relevance**: Understanding consciousness is vital for neuroscience research and clinical practice, particularly in differentiating states like coma, minimally conscious state, and normal wakefulness. Neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) are closely tied to brain activity patterns that accompany conscious experience.
7.  **Philosophical Implications**: Consciousness drives debates on fundamental questions like "What makes us, us?" and "Do we have free will?", linking to the mind-body problem and the "hard problem" of consciousness.

### Internal Implementation, Working Mechanisms, Principles, and Rules of Consciousness

Consciousness arises from specific brain activities and complex interactions rather than being a standalone entity.
1.  **Neural Substrates and Networks**: The **cerebral cortex** is often considered the "seat of consciousness" in humans and mammals, with crucial contributions from the **thalamo-cortical system** and its satellites. Small lesions in the midbrain, brain stem, and thalamus can lead to complete loss of consciousness, while specific cortical damage can eliminate particular aspects of awareness.
2.  **Dynamic Integration and Synchronization**: Consciousness is generated through mechanisms of **resonance, synchronization, and integration** of activity across different cortical and subcortical regions. The brain's activity in sustaining rich dynamics in neural activity is key to the "engine of consciousness".
3.  **Sequential Neural Loops and Feedback**: A neurofunctional model represents consciousness as an **epiphenomenon** resulting from the sequential activation of neural loops that reconfigure their functional states via feedback. The ascending reticular activating system, thalamocortical networks, and cortico-cortical networks support cognitive processes essential for consciousness.
4.  **Cellular Mechanisms**: Recent research highlights the central role of **cortical pyramidal neurons** in the mechanisms of consciousness, with a separation of forward and backward information flow in the cortex. Quantum processing in microtubules and the brain’s endogenous electromagnetic field are also considered important in some theories.
5.  **Principles Underlying Consciousness**:
    *   **Integration**: Conscious experience involves the integration of information across various brain regions.
    *   **Differentiation**: Consciousness also involves differentiation, distinguishing many distinct elements within conscious content.
    *   **Dynamic Self-Organization**: Consciousness is an autopoietic system, meaning it is self-creating and self-organizing, with each moment of experience growing coherently from prior ones.
    *   **Functionalism**: Qualia can be understood as properties of virtual machine states that make an agent prone to believe certain things about them (e.g., immediacy, privacy, intrinsicness, ineffability).
6.  **Computational and Functional Architectures**: Functional or access consciousness can be described as an ongoing dynamic process of **queries and answers** based on a computational architecture that integrates grounded representations with cognitive productivity. This interaction initiates the implicit query and answer process underlying functional consciousness.

### Phase-based Preconditions, Inputs, and Outputs of Consciousness

Consciousness is deeply linked to the brain's dynamic states and how it processes information through specific phases.
1.  **Phase-based Preconditions**:
    *   Conscious states are closely associated with **synchronized neural activity patterns** that show dynamical characteristics attributed to **self-organized criticality and phase transitions**.
    *   The brain operates near an **edge-of-chaos critical point**, balancing stability and chaos, which supports the rich information flow necessary for conscious states.
    *   Insights into the mechanism by which the brain controls these phase transitions are crucial for understanding how the brain transcends the threshold of consciousness.
    *   The coupling of the brain to the zero-point field (ZPF), involving resonant interaction of the ZPF with neurotransmitters like glutamate, is theorized to initiate phase transitions and form synchronized activity patterns.
    *   Pyramidal neurons in cortical microcolumns are considered ideally suited to control this interaction.
2.  **Inputs to Consciousness**:
    *   Inputs primarily originate from **sensory stimuli** from the external environment and **internal bodily signals**.
    *   These inputs, once identified and processed, acquire meaning through conscious mechanisms.
    *   The initial stages of processing for stimuli that become conscious are identical to those that do not, involving retinal receptors, thalamus, and primary visual cortex.
3.  **Outputs of Consciousness**:
    *   Consciousness functions as a selective, intermediate stage that enables **precise attention**.
    *   Outputs of consciousness include **specific behavioral patterns**, such as performing designated actions based on visual cues.
    *   Other outputs include **cognitive reflections, decision-making, and verbal reports** of awareness.
    *   The brain's ability to transform incoming data into an unambiguous summary, manipulate it sequentially, and communicate it are critical outputs of consciousness.

### Architectural Design Philosophy, Patterns, and Features Relevant to Consciousness

The architectural approach to consciousness explains features of consciousness using a virtual machine architecture.
1.  **Virtual Machine Functionalism (VMF)**: This approach proposes that qualia, as qualitative aspects of experiences, are properties of components within virtual machine states of a cognitive architecture. The VMF account suggests that agents become prone to believe that their states have properties like immediacy, privacy, intrinsicness, and ineffability, even if these propositions are not literally true.
2.  **Hierarchical Meta-Cognition**: A crucial architectural requirement for qualia includes a cognitive architecture with reactive, deliberative, and meta-management components, featuring at least two layers of meta-cognition. These layers involve detecting and using internal virtual machine components and holding beliefs about those components.
3.  **Grounded Sensorimotor Robotic Architectures**: The theory aims to make it intelligible how these requirements could be realized in a grounded, sensorimotor, cognitive robotic architecture. Such architectures can support notions of belief, inference, and meta-belief, which are necessary for the subjective, qualia aspect of consciousness.
4.  **Forward Models and Meta-Beliefs**: The design incorporates forward models (like 'Ew' for expected sensory input) that confer belief-like states and metamappings (like 'F' for beliefs about expectation models) that confer meta-belief-like states. These meta-beliefs can indicate which object-level belief states have particular content properties.
5.  **Addressing Logical Relations**: The architecture can be designed to observe and learn logical regularities between different networks, such as a conjunctive cue network (G) and a single cue network (F). Mismatches between these networks can generate error signals, leading to the system having an implicit notion of logical justification and consistency of its own beliefs.
6.  **Design Patterns for Efficiency**: Strategies for task performance in such architectures include exhaustive search of action space (Strategy One), exhaustive search of virtual action space (Strategy Two with variations for serial or content-addressable search), and learning a mapping from mappings to cues (Strategy Three, a lookup computation). Strategy Three, involving meta-cognition, is very fast as it directly answers existential conditions without finding specific points.
7.  **Consciousness as Intentional Design**: The overall philosophy suggests that consciousness itself is the ultimate form of intentional design, implying that individuals can actively and consciously design their lives. Architectural design influences consciousness by shaping the space and affecting emotional states.

### Contradictions, Trade-offs, and Decisions Related to Consciousness

Consciousness, being a complex phenomenon, is characterized by inherent contradictions, trade-offs, and intricate decision-making processes.
1.  **Contradictions**:
    *   **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: Consciousness is profoundly subjective ("what it is like to be") yet engages with an objective world, posing challenges for scientific study.
    *   **Unity vs. Multiplicity**: Consciousness presents as a unified, coherent experience, but it arises from the integration of diverse, distinct neural activities and contents. This balance between integration and differentiation is crucial for consciousness.
    *   **Awareness vs. Unawareness**: A significant portion of information processing occurs unconsciously, raising questions about why we are aware of some cognitions but not others. This challenges the idea that consciousness solely drives behavior, as unconscious decisions can precede conscious intentions.
    *   **Self-knowledge vs. Mystery**: While consciousness allows for introspection and self-awareness, aspects like the "hard problem" (explaining subjective experience from physical processes) remain deeply mysterious.
    *   **Pain as both support and interference**: Pain can sometimes interfere with rational trade-offs, creating a contradictory effect within conscious experience.
    *   **Conceptual Ambiguity**: The term "consciousness" itself has almost a hundred different interpretations, ranging from complete denial of its existence to metaphorical understandings, highlighting significant contradictions in definitions.
2.  **Trade-offs**:
    *   **Resource Allocation**: Conscious processing is resource-limited and slower compared to unconscious processing, leading to a trade-off where some tasks are offloaded to unconscious cognition for efficiency.
    *   **Online Performance vs. Offline Preparation**: Strategies for conscious processing often involve trade-offs between rapid online performance (e.g., direct lookup) and considerable "offline" preparation (e.g., learning forward models).
    *   **Information Richness vs. Specificity**: Psychedelics, for example, may increase the information richness of cortical activity by tuning low-frequency cortical oscillations closer to a critical point, suggesting a trade-off in the state of consciousness.
3.  **Decisions Related to Consciousness**:
    *   **Decision-making**: Consciousness plays a vital role in enabling decision-making, allowing individuals to choose actions and set priorities.
    *   **Autonomous Choice**: The concept of an "analog 'I'" in consciousness enables individuals to understand their place in the world, envision consequences, and make conscious choices.
    *   **Rationality**: Despite the potential for pain to interfere, consciousness supports the capacity for attentive interpretations of complex or ambiguous data, allowing for more rational decisions.

### Cause-and-Effect Relationships within Consciousness

Consciousness is intricately woven into a web of cause-and-effect relationships within the brain and its interaction with the environment.
1.  **Sensory Input and Neural Activity <-produce-> Conscious Experience**: Sensory information, processed through neural circuits, generates subjective conscious experiences. For instance, if a person sees a face, the fusiform face area shows increased activity, which is deeply related to the subjective conscious experience.
2.  **Brain Activity <-gives rise to-> Consciousness**: Consciousness is a product of neural activity, and lesions in specific brain structures can lead to specific malfunctions of consciousness. The brain's neurophysiological phenomena are two aspects of the same event.
3.  **Attention Mechanisms <-enhance-> Awareness of Stimuli**: Attention acts as a filter, focusing conscious experience and enhancing awareness of particular stimuli. This selectivity allows precise attention.
4.  **Self-Referential Processing <-supports-> Self-Awareness**: The ability to have beliefs about oneself and one's knowledge enables the propensities to believe in immediacy, privacy, intrinsicness, and ineffability, which are central to the concept of qualia and thus self-awareness.
5.  **Neural Network Dynamics <-enable-> Integration and Unity of Consciousness**: The brain's mechanisms of resonance, synchronization, and integration of activity across different regions contribute to a unified conscious state. This dynamic activity supports the vast flow of information through cortical networks during conscious states.
6.  **Conscious Identification of Information -triggers-> Specific Behavioral Patterns**: Conscious processing serves as an intermediate stage where neural information is identified, leading to specific, rather than non-specific or passive, behavioral responses.

### Interdependency Relationships within Consciousness

Consciousness is characterized by complex interdependencies, where various components mutually influence and rely on each other to form a coherent whole.
1.  **Attention <-is closely linked with-> Consciousness**: Research on attention is closely linked with advances in consciousness studies, exploring how attention relates to conscious awareness. The dependency of consciousness on attention can entail diverse conscious capacities.
2.  **Emotions <-are intimately linked with-> Consciousness**: Emotions and consciousness are deeply linked, often conceived not just intrapersonally but also as interpersonal and transpersonal systems, affecting conscious experiences.
3.  **Neural Networks <-shape and influence-> Conscious Experience**: Macroscopic neural networks, including the "default mode," are shaped by encultured social practices, which in turn depend upon and influence phenomenal and reflective consciousness.
4.  **Cognitive Processes <-are highly dependent on-> Conscious Experience**: Differentiated cognitive skills, such as language, thought, and social cognition, emerge within a single physiological space sustained by neural systems involved in consciousness.
5.  **Internal Models <-influence-> Conscious Perception**: Forward models within cognitive architectures influence expectations of sensory inputs, which in turn guide virtual and actual searches, illustrating a strong interdependency.
6.  **Logical Norms <-guide-> Meta-Beliefs**: In sophisticated architectures, a mismatch between meta-belief states that should respect logical norms can generate an error signal, guiding learning and adjustments within the system.

### Cardinality-based Relationships (1:1, 1:M, M:N) within Consciousness

Cardinality-based relationships describe the quantitative mappings between different aspects of consciousness, ranging from direct one-to-one correspondences to complex many-to-many interactions.
1.  **1:1 (One-to-One) Relationship**:
    *   This implies a unique and direct correspondence between specific instances. For example, phenomenal consciousness is what it is *like* to be in a particular state.
    *   A single conscious experience could be linked to a specific underlying neural state.
    *   Some philosophical ideas propose a 1:1 relationship between an individual's self and universal consciousness.
2.  **1:M (One-to-Many) Relationship**:
    *   A single cause or entity in consciousness can lead to multiple effects or manifestations. For instance, a particular parameter configuration of a forward model (a single entity) can manifest a range of expectational beliefs (many outputs).
    *   One specific brain state or condition, such as general anesthesia, can lead to different levels of altered consciousness, including minimally conscious state or coma.
3.  **M:N (Many-to-Many) Relationship**:
    *   This signifies complex, interconnected interactions where multiple elements of consciousness relate to multiple other elements.
    *   Numerous electrophysiological signatures contribute to differentiating states of consciousness.
    *   Consciousness arises from the integration and interaction of various neural mechanisms, including low-frequency power, EEG complexity, and information exchange, which synergize to classify a patient's state.
    *   Different brain regions and networks—such as the ascending reticular activating system, thalamocortical networks, and cortico-cortical networks—interact in a complex, mutually dependent way to sustain consciousness.
    *   The relationship between consciousness and attention is not a simple linear one but involves overlapping, multifaceted connections.

### Contradictory Relationships within Consciousness

Consciousness is replete with inherent contradictions that reflect its paradoxical nature, where seemingly opposing concepts coexist and interact.
1.  **Phenomenal Consciousness vs. Access Consciousness**: These are distinct yet often conflated aspects. Phenomenal consciousness is about "experience," or "what it is like to be in that state," whereas access-consciousness is about the availability of information for interaction and guidance. This creates a contradiction as one might have information available without the subjective experience, or vice-versa.
2.  **Integration vs. Differentiation**: Consciousness involves integrating diverse activities across brain regions to create a unified experience, yet it also requires differentiating these activities for detailed conscious content. This means consciousness balances being both a unified whole and a collection of distinct parts, presenting a contradiction in its organization.
3.  **Conscious vs. Unconscious Processes**: There's a fundamental contradiction between what we are consciously aware of and the vast amount of information processed unconsciously that influences our behavior and thoughts. Unconscious processes often have considerably larger resources and computing ability than consciousness, and decisions can appear earlier unconsciously than consciously. This challenges the intuitive notion that all purposeful behavior originates from conscious thought.
4.  **The "Hard Problem"**: The existence of consciousness itself presents a profound philosophical contradiction: how can subjective experience (qualia) arise from objective physical processes in the brain? This "explanatory gap" highlights the difficulty in reconciling the physical and the phenomenal aspects of consciousness.
5.  **Rationality and Pain**: Pain, a conscious experience, can paradoxically interfere with the ability to make rational trade-offs, showing that aspects of consciousness can be self-defeating or contradictory in their effects.
6.  **Human Nature and Self-Knowledge**: While humans are wired to seek meaning and pattern in experience, the process of self-knowledge, where consciousness explores itself, can reveal many contradictions and even threats generated by the mind to itself. This implies consciousness is both a tool for understanding and a source of internal conflict.

These contradictory relationships are not merely problems to be solved but are central to understanding the richness, flexibility, and adaptability of consciousness, requiring nuanced approaches that embrace paradox as an explanatory feature.

| **Consciousness (General Definition)** | The state of being aware of one's own existence, emotions, thoughts, and relationship to the environment; what it's like to be in a given state. | Subjective, unified, dynamic, adaptable, enables flexible behavior, integrates information. | **Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC)**: Specific neural processes and activities tied to conscious experience. **Brain-wide information sharing** is a signature of conscious processing. |
| **Core Elements & Components** | Fundamental aspects making up conscious experience. | **Wakefulness**: Alertness; **Awareness**: Content (perception, cognition, emotion, self); **Selective Attention**: Focus; **Qualia**: Subjective sensory qualities; **Self-Awareness**: Reflection on self. | ARAS activation; Thalamocortical/cortical integration; Frontoparietal networks; Default Mode Network. |
| **Structure** | The organizational framework of consciousness. | Hierarchical (Core/Extended), integrated, phenomenal (spatial, temporal, causal organization). | Resonance, synchronization, integration across brain regions; Virtual machine states; "Stream of consciousness". |
| **Context** | Internal and external factors influencing conscious experience. | Multidimensional (internal states, external sensory inputs, social/cultural environment). | Emotions, memories, environmental design, metaphorical language. |
| **Related Concepts** | Terms closely associated with or contributing to consciousness. | Awareness, Qualia, Attention, Phenomenal consciousness, Access consciousness, Intentionality. | Differentiated by specific functional roles or experiential qualities. |
| **Functions & Purposes** | The roles and adaptive values of consciousness. | Information integration, decision-making, behavioral flexibility, self-reflection, planning, survival advantage, providing intrinsic value. | Cognitive control, problem-solving, social interaction, adapting to novel situations. |
| **Types & Styles** | Different forms and manners of conscious experience. | **Types**: Intransitive, Transitive, Self-, Phenomenal, Access, Narrative, Core, Extended; **Styles**: Reflective, Pre-reflective, Concrete, Abstract, Embodied. | Clinical observations (coma, MCS); Neurophysiological studies (EEG); Behavioral data (mirror test). |
| **Internal Implementation & Mechanisms** | How consciousness arises and operates at a neural and computational level. | Neural substrates, dynamic integration, sequential neural loops, cellular processes (pyramidal neurons), principles of integration/differentiation, autopoiesis. | Thalamo-cortical system, ascending reticular activating system, synchronized neural activity, forward/backward information flow. |
| **Phase-based Preconditions, Inputs, Outputs** | Conditions, information flow, and results of conscious states. | **Preconditions**: Near-critical brain dynamics, phase transitions; **Inputs**: Sensory signals, internal states; **Outputs**: Behavioral decisions, motor actions, cognitive reflections, verbal reports. | Self-organized criticality, glutamate-ZPF coupling, P300 wave in EEG, flexible adaptive behavior. |
| **Architectural Design Philosophy & Features** | Conceptual framework for consciousness in systems (biological/artificial). | Virtual Machine Functionalism (VMF), hierarchical meta-cognition, grounded sensorimotor architectures, dynamic interaction/feedback, trade-offs between online/offline processing. | Metamappings for meta-beliefs, error signals for logical consistency, strategies for task performance. |
| **Contradictions & Trade-offs** | Inherent tensions and optimization dilemmas in consciousness. | **Contradictions**: Subjectivity vs. Objectivity, Unity vs. Multiplicity, Awareness vs. Unawareness, Self-knowledge vs. Mystery, Consistency vs. Contradiction. **Trade-offs**: Resource allocation (conscious vs. unconscious), online vs. offline processing. | "Hard problem" of consciousness; Pain interfering with rationality; Ambiguity of "consciousness" definition. |
| **Cause-Effect & Interdependencies** | Dynamic and reciprocal influences among conscious components. | **Cause-Effect**: Sensory Input and Neural Activity <-produce-> Conscious Experience; Attention Mechanisms <-enhance-> Awareness of Stimuli; Self-Referential Processing <-supports-> Self-Awareness. **Interdependencies**: Attention <-is closely linked with-> Consciousness; Emotions <-are intimately linked with-> Consciousness. | Brain activity -> consciousness; Neural network dynamics -> integration/unity. |
| **Cardinality-based Relationships** | Quantitative mappings between conscious states/processes. | **1:1**: Unique correspondence (e.g., specific perception to neural pattern). **1:M**: One entity affects multiple others (e.g., one attention focus -> multiple behaviors). **M:N**: Multiple entities interact dynamically (e.g., many brain regions -> unified experience). | Examples include specific neural activations, distributed influences of attention, and complex network interactions. |
