Consciousness

Tue Jul 01 2025

Consciousness is a multifaceted and challenging concept that broadly refers to awareness, whether of internal states, external objects, or one's own existence. It is considered one of the most familiar yet puzzling aspects of the mind, with no single, universally agreed-upon definition among philosophers and scientists.

### Defining Consciousness

The term "consciousness" has evolved over centuries, with its English usage dating back to the 17th century, derived from the Latin "conscius" meaning "knowing with" or "having joint knowledge". Historically, John Locke's 1690 definition as "the perception of what passes in a man's own mind" significantly influenced 18th-century British philosophy. Modern dictionary definitions reflect a range of related meanings, often centering on awareness, perception, sensation, emotion, volition, or thought.

Despite common understanding, a precise, theory-independent definition remains elusive due to approximately forty attributed meanings. Some basic definitions include "being aware of one's existence" or "being aware of being aware of something". In a medical context, consciousness describes a patient's arousal and responsiveness, ranging from full alertness to a loss of movement in response to painful stimuli, which can be measured using scales like the Glasgow Coma Scale.

### Diverse Perspectives on Consciousness

Consciousness is approached from various perspectives, highlighting its complex and interdisciplinary nature, encompassing philosophical, scientific, and cultural viewpoints.

#### Philosophical Perspectives
Philosophers often differentiate between aspects of consciousness, such as phenomenal consciousness (P-consciousness) and access consciousness (A-consciousness).
-   **P-consciousness**: This refers to raw subjective experience, such as colored forms, sounds, sensations, emotions, and feelings, which are often called qualia. It is described as "what it is like" to be in a certain state and is difficult to define non-circularly.
-   **A-consciousness**: This involves information in the mind that is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and behavioral control.
The distinction between P-consciousness and A-consciousness is debated, with some, like David Chalmers, calling the understanding of P-consciousness the "hard problem of consciousness". There is also discussion about whether these two types can exist independently.
Philosophical stances on the mind-body problem also influence how consciousness is viewed. While physicalism is dominant among contemporary philosophers of mind, dualist solutions maintain a distinction between consciousness and matter, whereas monist solutions propose a single realm of being. René Descartes, for instance, proposed mind-body dualism, suggesting consciousness resides in an immaterial realm (res cogitans) interacting with material things (res extensa), possibly in the pineal gland.

#### Scientific Perspectives
Scientists study consciousness through empirical methods, focusing on observable behaviors and neural activity.
-   **Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC)**: A major focus is identifying the brain activity that strongly predicts conscious awareness. Techniques like EEG and fMRI are used to measure brain activity during conscious experiences. The prefrontal cortex, involved in higher cognitive functions, and high-frequency (gamma band) oscillations have drawn attention.
-   **Measurement of Consciousness**: Verbal reports are widely used as indicators of consciousness in human subjects, though they present challenges because subjects might be wrong about their own experiences. Other indicators in medicine include arousal, brain activity, and purposeful movement, especially when verbal behavior is absent. The mirror test is used to study self-awareness in humans and other species. The perturbational complexity index (PCI) has been proposed as a quantitative measure, showing higher values in awake or REM sleep states compared to deep sleep or vegetative states.

#### Cultural and Other Perspectives
Different cultures and disciplines offer varying understandings. Western psychology often views consciousness as a product of the brain arising from neurological processes, contrasting with some Eastern views that see consciousness as transient or eternal, and independent of the mind or brain. Some theories also explore consciousness through its biological function and evolution, considering its survival value and when it might have first emerged in evolutionary history.

### Latest Research and Theories

The scientific study of consciousness has gained momentum, moving beyond traditional philosophical debates to active empirical investigation. Researchers are exploring various theoretical models and neural underpinnings.

#### Prominent Theories
Many empirical theories of consciousness have been proposed, with some being more notable than others.
-   **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**: Proposed by Bernard Baars, this cognitive architecture views conscious processes as an illuminated "stage" where inputs from various unconscious networks are integrated and then broadcast to other unconscious networks.
-   **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: Pioneered by Giulio Tononi, IIT posits that consciousness arises when information reaches a certain level of complexity and attempts to map conscious states to precise mathematical descriptions. However, the theory remains controversial due to its lack of credibility.
-   **Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR)**: Proposed by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff, this quantum theory suggests consciousness originates at the quantum level within microtubules inside neurons. Although quantum vibrations inside microtubules were discovered in 2014, experimental evidence has largely been against this notion.
-   **Attention Schema Theory (AST)**: Michael Graziano and Kastner proposed this theory in 2011, suggesting specific cortical areas build the construct of awareness and attribute it to others and oneself. In this theory, awareness is a simplified schema representing attentional states.
-   **Entropic Brain Theory**: This theory, informed by neuroimaging with psychedelic drugs, suggests that primary states of consciousness (like REM sleep or under psychedelics) are disordered, while normal waking consciousness constrains this freedom for metacognitive functions.
-   **Projective Consciousness Model (PCM)**: This model applies the active inference paradigm to consciousness, describing how sensory data is integrated with prior information through projective transformation, though it doesn't fully solve the "hard problem".
-   **Claustrum as a Conductor/Router**: Francis Crick and Christof Koch proposed in 2004 that the claustrum might act as a "conductor" to bind experiences. A 2014 study where stimulating a woman's claustrum induced unconsciousness supported its role in maintaining consciousness. However, a 2022 study opposed this, suggesting the claustrum acts more like a "router" transferring information, with complex tasks being impaired when it's disabled.

Latest research continues to explore where consciousness arises in the brain, with some findings suggesting sensory zones at the back of the brain, rather than just the frontal areas, play a role. The field is actively working towards quantitative assessments and a deeper understanding of the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying consciousness.
