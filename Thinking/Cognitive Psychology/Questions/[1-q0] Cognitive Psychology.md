Cognitive psychology is the scientific study of how individuals think, perceive, remember, learn, and solve problems. It investigates inner mental processes that form human behavior, such as attention, perception, memory, action planning, and language. This field aims to understand how we acquire, process, and store information. Cognitive psychology emphasizes the internal mental processes required to make sense of the environment and determine appropriate actions. It considers thoughts and feelings as active components in forming behavior, contrasting with earlier views that saw individuals as passive recipients. This domain draws parallels between the human mind and a computer, conceptualizing mental operations as information processing stages involving input, processing, storage, and output. The field originated in the 1950s as a reaction to behavioral psychology, which focused solely on observable behavior. Early contributions include Franciscus Donders' work on reaction time in 1868 and Hermann Ebbinghaus's studies on human memory. Ulric Neisser formally introduced the term "cognitive psychology" in 1967, defining it as the study of processes behind the perception, transformation, storage, and recovery of information. The field continues to evolve, integrating insights from cognitive neuroscience, neuropsychology, and computational science to build a more comprehensive understanding of cognition.

### Intermediate Cognitive Psychology Questions and Answers

Intermediate cognitive psychology questions build upon basic concepts, delving deeper into the mechanisms, models, and interactions of mental processes. They explore how different cognitive functions work together and the factors influencing their efficiency.

1.  **What is the role of attention in cognitive processing?**
    Attention is a fundamental cognitive process that enables us to **selectively focus on relevant information**, filter out distractions, and efficiently allocate mental resources. It acts like a **spotlight** that highlights important information, determining what is processed more deeply.
2.  **How does selective attention work?**
    **Selective attention** allows an individual to concentrate on a specific stimulus or task while ignoring other competing stimuli. The **bottleneck model** by Donald Broadbent suggests that selection occurs early in processing, filtering information based on physical characteristics. This is exemplified by the **cocktail party phenomenon**, where one can focus on a single conversation in a noisy room.
3.  **What are the different types of memory and how do they function?**
    Memory is broadly categorized into **sensory memory** (brief storage of sensory input), **short-term memory** (temporary storage for active processing), and **long-term memory** (durable storage for vast amounts of information). Each type has distinct capacities and durations, analogous to different kinds of **storage systems**.
4.  **How is information encoded, stored, and retrieved in memory?**
    **Encoding** transforms sensory information into a form usable by memory (like saving a file). **Storage** maintains the encoded information over time (like keeping it on a hard drive). **Retrieval** is the process of accessing stored information (like opening the file when needed).
5.  **What influences effective retrieval of memories?**
    Effective memory retrieval is influenced by factors such as the presence of **retrieval cues**, the **context** during encoding and retrieval, and even one's emotional state. This is similar to how finding a book in a library is easier if you know its specific section or neighboring books.
6.  **What causes memory errors and distortions?**
    Memory is not a perfect record but a reconstructive process, prone to errors and distortions due to factors like **misinformation**, **biases**, and the influence of **schemas**. This means memories can be **altered or fabricated** over time, much like a story changing slightly with each retelling.
7.  **How do schemas influence perception and memory?**
    **Schemas** are cognitive frameworks or mental models developed from prior knowledge and experiences. They guide how we interpret new sensory input and organize stored memories, acting like a **mental filter** that shapes our understanding of the world.

    The **computer analogy** compares the human mind to a computer system, suggesting that cognition involves **information processing** through sequential stages: input, processing, storage, and output. This metaphor helped establish a framework for studying the mind scientifically.
9.  **How do bottom-up and top-down processing differ in perception?**
    **Bottom-up processing** is data-driven, starting with raw sensory input and building up a perception (e.g., recognizing lines and colors). **Top-down processing** is knowledge-driven, using prior experiences, expectations, and schemas to interpret sensory data (e.g., recognizing a familiar face).
10. **What is the working memory model and its components?**
    Baddeley's **working memory model** proposes a system for temporarily holding and manipulating information, consisting of a **central executive** (for control and allocation of attention), a **phonological loop** (for auditory and verbal information), and a **visuospatial sketchpad** (for visual and spatial information). A later addition is the **episodic buffer**, integrating information from other components and long-term memory.
11. **How does attention as a limited resource affect multitasking?**
    Attention is considered a **limited resource**, meaning individuals can only process a certain amount of information at one time. When attempting to **multitask** (divided attention), this limited capacity is spread across tasks, often leading to reduced performance and increased errors.
12. **What are the key models of problem-solving?**
    Key models include **trial-and-error**, **algorithms** (step-by-step procedures guaranteeing a solution), and **heuristics** (mental shortcuts that provide a quick, though not always optimal, solution). These are like using a **detailed map** (algorithm) versus taking a **known shortcut** (heuristic) to reach a destination.
13. **How do heuristics influence decision making?**
    **Heuristics** are mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that simplify complex decisions and speed up judgment. While often efficient, they can sometimes lead to **cognitive biases**, which are systematic errors in judgment that deviate from rationality.
14. **What differentiates implicit and explicit memory?**
    **Implicit memory** is unconscious and influences behavior without awareness (e.g., procedural skills like riding a bike, or classical conditioning). **Explicit memory** involves conscious and intentional recall of information, divided into **episodic memory** (personal experiences) and **semantic memory** (facts and general knowledge).
15. **How do language comprehension and production involve cognitive processes?**
    Language processing requires complex cognitive operations, including **parsing syntax** (analyzing sentence structure), **semantics** (deriving meaning from words and sentences), and **pragmatics** (understanding context-dependent meaning, like sarcasm). This multi-level analysis allows for understanding and generating coherent communication.
16. **What is cognitive development across the lifespan?**
    **Cognitive development** refers to the changes in mental processes and abilities, such as memory, reasoning, and problem-solving, that occur from childhood through adulthood and old age. It examines how these abilities are acquired, refine, and potentially decline over time.
17. **How do cognitive biases affect judgment?**
    **Cognitive biases** are systematic patterns of deviation from rational judgment, leading individuals to create their own "subjective reality" based on their perceptions rather than objective input. These biases can result in perceptual distortions and inaccurate judgments.
18. **What is the role of attention in perception and memory?**
    Attention acts as a gatekeeper, determining which sensory information is processed and thus perceived, and subsequently, which information gets encoded into memory. Without attention, information may not be registered or remembered effectively, much like a **security guard deciding who enters a building**.
19. **How is mental imagery used in cognition?**
    **Mental imagery** involves the creation and manipulation of mental representations that resemble sensory experiences (e.g., visualizing a path or an object). It plays a crucial role in **memory retrieval**, **problem-solving**, and **spatial reasoning**.
20. **What is the difference between declarative and procedural memory?**
    **Declarative memory** (a type of explicit memory) is "knowing that," referring to facts, concepts, and events that can be consciously recalled (e.g., remembering historical dates). **Procedural memory** (a type of implicit memory) is "knowing how," referring to skills and habits performed without conscious thought (e.g., riding a bicycle or typing).
21. **How do models explain language acquisition?**
    Models of **language acquisition** propose various mechanisms, including **innate predispositions** (e.g., Noam Chomsky's universal grammar suggesting an inborn language acquisition device) and **statistical learning** (learning patterns from environmental input). These approaches explain how children rapidly acquire complex linguistic abilities.
22. **What are cognitive maps, and how do they aid navigation?**
    A **cognitive map** is a type of **mental representation** of spatial and relational information about an environment. Introduced by Edward Tolman, these maps help individuals **navigate their surroundings**, organize spatial knowledge, and make decisions about routes, acting like a **mental GPS**.
23. **How is attention studied experimentally?**
    Attention is studied using various experimental paradigms, such as **dichotic listening tasks** (presenting different auditory stimuli to each ear to study selective attention) and **visual search tasks** (requiring detection of a target among distractors). These methods help to understand how attention operates and its limits.
24. **How does cognitive psychology inform therapy methods like CBT?**
    Cognitive psychology has significantly influenced therapy methods such as **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** and **Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy**. By understanding how thinking patterns contribute to psychological distress (e.g., negative schemas in depression), these therapies help individuals identify and modify maladaptive thoughts to improve mental well-being.
25. **What is the role of cognitive neuroscience in understanding cognition?**
    **Cognitive neuroscience** is an interdisciplinary field that combines cognitive psychology with neuroscience, using **neuroimaging methods** (e.g., fMRI, EEG) to examine brain activity associated with cognitive processes. It helps to link mental functions (e.g., perception, memory) to specific brain mechanisms and structures.
26. **How do factors like emotion and motivation influence cognitive processes?**
    **Emotions** and **motivation** play a significant role in cognitive processes, influencing **attention** (e.g., emotional arousal can enhance or impair focus), **memory encoding** (e.g., emotionally charged events are often remembered vividly), and **decision-making** (e.g., mood can bias choices).
27. **What is the difference between deductive and inductive reasoning?**
    **Deductive reasoning** moves from general principles to specific conclusions, where the conclusion is guaranteed if the premises are true (e.g., "All humans are mortal; John is human; therefore, John is mortal"). **Inductive reasoning** moves from specific observations to broader generalizations, where conclusions are probable but not certain (e.g., "Every swan I've seen is white; therefore, all swans are white").
28. **How do conceptual hierarchies organize knowledge?**
    **Conceptual hierarchies** organize knowledge in a structured manner, arranging concepts from broad, general categories to more specific subcategories. This hierarchical organization allows for efficient storage and retrieval of information, much like a **family tree** for concepts.
29. **What are the stages of information processing in cognition?**
    The **information processing approach** in cognitive psychology outlines a series of stages through which information flows: **input** (sensory reception), **encoding** (transformation of information), **storage** (retention in memory), **retrieval** (accessing stored information), and **output** (behavioral response). This sequence is analogous to a computer's operations.
30. **How do environmental and biological factors interact in cognitive psychology?**
    Cognitive psychology recognizes that mental processes are shaped by a complex interaction between **biological factors** (e.g., brain structure, genetics) and **environmental factors** (e.g., learning experiences, cultural influences). This interaction highlights the interplay of "nature and nurture" in shaping cognition.
31. **What is the significance of reaction time research in cognition?**
    **Reaction time** research measures the time elapsed between a stimulus and a response, providing insights into the speed and complexity of underlying mental processes. It allows cognitive psychologists to make **inferences about unobservable cognitive operations**, such as stages of processing or attentional allocation.
32. **How do cognitive psychologists use controlled experiments?**
    Cognitive psychologists predominantly use **highly controlled laboratory experiments** to study mental processes, allowing them to **manipulate specific independent variables** and measure their effects on dependent variables. This approach minimizes extraneous variables and helps establish **causal relationships** between cognitive phenomena.
33. **What is the role of schemas in selective attention?**
    **Schemas** guide selective attention by influencing what information is deemed relevant and thus prioritized for processing. They allow individuals to focus cognitive resources on schema-consistent information and ignore inconsistent or irrelevant details, acting like **cognitive filters**.
34. **How do people solve analogical problems?**
    **Analogical problem-solving** involves recognizing a structural or relational similarity between a current problem (target) and a previously encountered problem (source), and then applying or adapting the solution from the source to the target. It's a powerful strategy where past experiences inform new solutions.
35. **How does language processing involve syntactic and semantic analysis?**
    Language processing requires both **syntactic analysis** (parsing sentences according to grammatical rules) and **semantic analysis** (extracting meaning from words and sentences). For full comprehension, these analyses must integrate with **pragmatic understanding** (contextual meaning), making language a multi-layered cognitive challenge.
36. **What are the common methods in cognitive psychological research?**
    Common research methods in cognitive psychology include **controlled experiments**, **case studies** (especially in cognitive neuropsychology), **self-report measures**, and **observational studies**. The field also utilizes **computational modeling** and techniques from cognitive neuroscience.

    The **central executive** component of working memory is crucial for **attentional control** and **suppressing irrelevant information**, enabling focus on complex tasks. This executive function allows for efficient allocation of cognitive resources, preventing interference and supporting goal-directed behavior.
2.  **What neural processes underlie attention deficits in disorders such as ADHD?**
    Attention deficits, as seen in disorders like ADHD, are often linked to dysfunctions in brain regions such as the **prefrontal cortex** and **parietal lobes**, which are critical for higher-order cognitive functions and spatial awareness. These areas are responsible for maintaining sustained attention and managing selective attention.
3.  **How does chronic stress affect memory function and cognitive decline?**
    Chronic stress can negatively impact memory function by affecting brain structures involved in memory, such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Prolonged stress can impair **memory consolidation**, reduce cognitive flexibility, and accelerate age-related cognitive decline.
4.  **What cognitive and neural underpinnings explain the Stroop effect and its implications for selective attention?**
    The **Stroop effect** is explained by the **automaticity of reading**, which creates strong interference with the more controlled task of naming ink colors. Neuroimaging studies reveal that brain regions involved in conflict monitoring and cognitive control, such as the anterior cingulate cortex, are active during Stroop tasks, highlighting the neural basis of selective attention.
5.  **How does cognitive flexibility contribute to problem-solving and decision-making under uncertainty?**
    **Cognitive flexibility** is the ability to adapt thinking and behavior in response to changing situations or new information. It allows individuals to switch between different strategies, consider multiple perspectives, and adjust their plans when faced with uncertainty, which is essential for effective problem-solving and adaptive decision-making.
6.  **What are the computational models explaining perception and how do they integrate bottom-up and top-down processing?**
    Computational models of perception describe how the brain processes sensory information by integrating **bottom-up processing** (data-driven, from sensory organs) with **top-down processing** (concept-driven, using prior knowledge and expectations). These models propose algorithms that the brain might use to construct perceptions, explaining phenomena like pattern recognition and object constancy.
7.  **How do encoding specificity and retrieval processes interact to form reliable long-term memories?**
    The **encoding specificity principle** states that memory retrieval is most effective when the retrieval cues available at the time of recall match the cues that were present during encoding. This interaction ensures that the context and internal state present during learning facilitate access to the stored information in long-term memory.
8.  **What role does cognitive load play in divided attention and multitasking performance?**
    **Cognitive load** refers to the total amount of mental effort being used in working memory. In divided attention and multitasking scenarios, high cognitive load can impair performance because the limited resources of working memory are distributed, leading to reduced efficiency and increased errors.
9.  **How can cognitive neuroscience techniques (e.g., fMRI, ERP) elucidate temporal vs. spatial resolution in brain activity?**
    **Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)** provides excellent **spatial resolution**, showing *where* brain activity occurs by detecting changes in blood flow. **Event-Related Potentials (ERP)** from EEG provide excellent **temporal resolution**, indicating *when* cognitive processes occur by measuring electrical activity in response to stimuli.
10. **What are the cognitive biases involved in judgment under uncertainty and how do heuristics differ from algorithms in this context?**
    Judgment under uncertainty is often influenced by **cognitive biases**, systematic errors arising from reliance on **heuristics** (mental shortcuts). Unlike **algorithms**, which are precise, step-by-step procedures guaranteeing a correct solution, heuristics are approximate strategies that are fast and efficient but do not always yield the optimal or correct answer.
11. **How do schemas influence the encoding and retrieval of memories and perception of new information?**
    **Schemas** are organized knowledge structures that actively guide the encoding and retrieval of memories by influencing what information is attended to, interpreted, and stored. They also shape the perception of new information, often leading to selective processing or distortion to fit pre-existing expectations.
12. **What are the interactions between emotion and cognition, especially in memory formation and decision-making?**
    Emotions and cognition are highly interactive. Strong emotions can **enhance memory formation** for significant events (e.g., flashbulb memories) but can also distort recall. In decision-making, emotions can lead to **biased judgments** or influence risk assessment, demonstrating that cognition is not purely rational.
13. **How does top-down processing affect perception and attention in complex environments like the cocktail party effect?**
    **Top-down processing**, driven by an individual's expectations or goals, is critical for filtering information in complex environments. In the **cocktail party effect**, it allows an individual to selectively attend to one conversation amidst background noise by using prior knowledge and context to prioritize relevant auditory input.
14. **What are the neuropsychological correlates of working memory, and how does prefrontal cortex damage impact it?**
    Neuropsychological research indicates that the **prefrontal cortex** is a primary neural correlate of working memory, involved in maintaining and manipulating information. Damage to this region can significantly disrupt working memory capacity and executive control, leading to difficulties with tasks requiring active information processing.
15. **How do feature detectors in the brain contribute to visual and auditory processing?**
    **Feature detectors** are specialized neurons in the brain that respond to specific characteristics of stimuli, such as lines, angles, movements, or specific frequencies. These detectors act as building blocks for perception, allowing the brain to construct complex visual and auditory experiences from basic components.
16. **How does cognitive processing of language operate in the brain, including syntactic and semantic understanding?**
    Language processing involves a distributed network in the brain, with regions like Broca's area and Wernicke's area being central. **Syntactic understanding** involves analyzing grammatical structure, while **semantic understanding** involves extracting meaning. Neuroimaging studies reveal specialized neural pathways for these distinct yet integrated processes.
17. **What mechanisms enable the brain to reorganize cognitive functions after injury (neuroplasticity)?**
    **Neuroplasticity** refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections or strengthening existing ones in response to experience or injury. This involves mechanisms like **synaptic plasticity** and **neurogenesis**, allowing other brain areas to take over functions previously performed by damaged regions.
18. **How do the central executive and slave systems in Baddeley's Working Memory Model coordinate during multitasking?**
    In **Baddeley's Working Memory Model**, the **central executive** acts as an attentional control system, coordinating information flow between the **phonological loop** (verbal information) and the **visuospatial sketchpad** (visual/spatial information) during multitasking. It allocates resources and switches attention between tasks to manage simultaneous demands.
19. **How does the brain implement attentional selection mechanisms in early vs. late selection models?**
    **Early selection models** propose that sensory information is filtered based on physical characteristics *before* meaning is processed (e.g., Broadbent's model). **Late selection models** suggest that all information is processed for meaning, and selection occurs *after* semantic analysis. The brain implements these through complex neural networks that can adjust filtering based on task demands.
20. **What are the effects of cognitive interference and inhibition on memory and attention?**
    **Cognitive interference** occurs when processing one piece of information disrupts the processing or recall of another. **Inhibition** is the active suppression of irrelevant information or responses. Both can impact memory retrieval and attentional focus, demonstrating the brain's struggle to manage competing cognitive demands.
21. **How is consciousness linked with cognitive processes such as perception and decision-making?**
    Consciousness is intricately linked with various cognitive processes; it involves an awareness of both internal states and the external environment. While many cognitive processes occur nonconsciously, conscious awareness is critical for complex decision-making, planning, and reflective thought, enabling individuals to control behavior and respond adaptively.
22. **What is the cognitive basis for problem representation and restructuring in insight problem-solving?**
    In **insight problem-solving**, the cognitive basis involves how an individual initially **represents the problem** and the ability to **restructure** that representation to find a novel solution. This often involves breaking away from typical mental sets or rigid thinking patterns to perceive the problem in a new way.
23. **How do episodic and semantic memory systems differ in function and neural substrates?**
    **Episodic memory** stores personally experienced events with their contextual details (e.g., "what I had for breakfast yesterday") and is primarily associated with the hippocampus. **Semantic memory** stores general knowledge and facts independent of personal experience (e.g., "Paris is the capital of France") and involves broader cortical networks.
24. **How do different learning theories (e.g., behaviorism vs. cognitive approaches) explain skill acquisition?**
    **Behaviorism** explains skill acquisition through **reinforcement** and **punishment**, focusing on observable stimulus-response associations. **Cognitive approaches**, however, emphasize internal mental processes like **schema formation**, **information processing**, and **problem-solving strategies**, suggesting learning involves understanding and internal representation.
25. **What is the role of heuristics in cognitive shortcuts, and when do they lead to errors?**
    **Heuristics** serve as cognitive shortcuts that enable quick judgments and decisions, especially under time constraints or with incomplete information. They lead to errors, or **biases**, when the simplified rule does not apply well to a specific situation or when individuals over-rely on them without critical evaluation.
26. **How does mental rotation ability relate to spatial cognition and intelligence?**
    **Mental rotation ability** is a core component of **spatial cognition**, involving the capacity to mentally rotate two- or three-dimensional objects. It is strongly correlated with measures of fluid intelligence and problem-solving skills, suggesting its importance in complex cognitive tasks requiring spatial manipulation.
27. **How do dual-process theories explain the interaction of automatic and controlled cognitive processes?**
    **Dual-process theories** propose that cognition involves two distinct systems: a fast, intuitive, and often **automatic** system (System 1) and a slower, deliberate, and **controlled** system (System 2). These systems interact, with automatic processes often initiating responses that are then monitored and, if necessary, overridden by controlled processes.
28. **What are the cognitive underpinnings of language acquisition and development?**
    The cognitive underpinnings of language acquisition involve intricate interactions between innate predispositions (e.g., for grammar) and environmental learning (e.g., statistical patterns in speech). These mechanisms enable children to rapidly develop complex linguistic abilities, including phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics.
29. **How does the brain encode and decode complex sensory information for perception?**
    The brain encodes complex sensory information by transforming raw input (e.g., light waves) into neural signals, which are then processed by specialized areas (e.g., feature detectors) to extract meaningful features. Decoding involves integrating these features with existing knowledge to construct a coherent perception, often through recursive top-down and bottom-up interactions.
30. **How do neuroimaging methods inform our understanding of brain connectivity?**
    Neuroimaging methods, such as fMRI and EEG, inform our understanding of **brain connectivity** by revealing patterns of correlated activity between different brain regions. This allows researchers to map functional networks and understand how different parts of the brain communicate and cooperate to support cognitive functions.
31. **What cognitive mechanisms underlie attentional blink and lapses in sustained attention?**
    **Attentional blink** refers to a brief period after processing one target during which a second target cannot be detected, suggesting a temporary depletion of attentional resources. **Lapses in sustained attention** occur when the ability to maintain focus over prolonged periods diminishes, often linked to fatigue or low arousal. These phenomena highlight the dynamic and limited nature of attentional capacity.
32. **How does working memory capacity affect learning and reasoning tasks?**
    **Working memory capacity** significantly influences performance in learning and reasoning tasks because it determines how much information can be actively held and manipulated. Individuals with higher working memory capacity tend to perform better on tasks requiring complex thought, comprehension, and problem-solving.
33. **What are the roles of the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad in short-term memory?**
    In Baddeley's model, the **phonological loop** is responsible for processing and temporarily storing verbal and auditory information (e.g., remembering a phone number), while the **visuospatial sketchpad** handles visual and spatial information (e.g., mentally manipulating shapes). They function as separate yet interactive "slave systems" of the central executive.
34. **How can cognitive experimental paradigms like the Flanker and N-Back tasks reveal executive function processes?**
    The **Flanker task** measures **selective attention** and **inhibition** by requiring participants to respond to a central stimulus while ignoring distracting flankers. The **N-Back task** assesses **working memory** and **attention** by requiring participants to identify if a current stimulus matches one presented 'n' steps back. Both reveal aspects of executive functions, such as inhibitory control and updating working memory.
35. **How does the brain process conflicting information during the Color-Word Stroop task?**
    During the **Stroop task**, the brain processes conflicting information by engaging regions involved in **cognitive control** and **conflict resolution**, such as the anterior cingulate cortex. The automatic processing of the word's meaning interferes with the task of naming the ink color, leading to slower reaction times and greater neural activity in these control regions.
36. **How do cognitive psychologists measure and interpret the temporal resolution of neural events?**
    Cognitive psychologists measure the **temporal resolution** of neural events using techniques like **EEG** and **MEG**, which detect electrical and magnetic signals from the brain with millisecond precision. This allows them to identify the precise timing of cognitive processes, such as when attention is allocated or when a memory is retrieved.
37. **How does lateralization of brain function affect cognitive abilities?**
    **Lateralization of brain function** refers to the specialization of the brain's hemispheres for certain cognitive abilities (e.g., language processing predominantly in the left hemisphere, spatial reasoning often more in the right). While both hemispheres work together, specific functions may be more efficiently processed in one side, influencing overall cognitive capabilities.
38. **How do external distractions influence cognitive task performance and attention allocation?**
    **External distractions** (e.g., loud noises, visual clutter) can significantly influence cognitive task performance by diverting attention, increasing cognitive load, and interfering with processing. The brain must allocate resources to suppress or process these distractions, reducing the resources available for the primary task.
39. **What are the cognitive processes involved in schema formation and modification?**
    **Schema formation** involves integrating new experiences and knowledge into existing cognitive structures. **Schema modification** occurs when new information is inconsistent with existing schemas, leading to assimilation (incorporating new info into existing schema) or accommodation (modifying the schema or creating a new one). These dynamic processes allow for continuous learning and adaptation.
40. **How is cognitive capacity measured, and what limits does it impose on multitasking and memory?**
    **Cognitive capacity** is often measured by tasks that assess working memory span (e.g., digit span task) or the ability to handle multiple streams of information. It imposes significant limits on multitasking and memory because the brain has a **finite amount of processing resources**, meaning that exceeding this capacity leads to performance decrements and information loss.
