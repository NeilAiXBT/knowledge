### Classification of 'Whose' Questions and Answers by Difficulty Level

This report provides a comprehensive classification of 'whose' questions and answers across three distinct difficulty levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced. This categorization is designed to enhance clarity and provide a structured approach to understanding and utilizing 'whose' questions in various contexts. The classification draws upon criteria related to the cognitive demand, contextual complexity, and the nature of the information sought or implied by each question.

#### Classification Criteria

The difficulty of questions can be assessed based on their characteristics, such as the correct answer rate, question type, and solution time. In a broader sense, the level of question difficulty can be affected by the characteristics of the question or the type of learning or problem-solving model used. For the purpose of classifying 'whose' questions, a framework that progresses from fundamental understanding to nuanced critical reasoning is employed, similar to how learning management systems (LMS) classify questions to recommend appropriate content to students. This ensures that questions are suitable for learners based on their individual abilities.

*   **Basic Level**: Questions at this level focus on fundamental and straightforward queries about **possession** or **direct association** [Result 0]. They typically expect a direct, **factual response**, requiring simple recognition or recall [Result 0]. These questions establish foundational understanding and identify key subjects [Result 0]. For instance, a beginner-level question might solely focus on identifying what a service is.
*   **Intermediate Level**: This level moves beyond simple association to explore more **contextual or functional relationships** [Result 0]. Questions may involve reasoning about ownership in varying scenarios or basic inferential contexts [Result 0]. They gauge comprehension of underlying connections or responsibilities associated with possession, requiring the application of knowledge to slightly more complex situations than mere identification [Result 0]. Intermediate-level questions assess an understanding of how to use a service to achieve basic tasks.
*   **Advanced Level**: Advanced questions involve **complex, multi-layered reasoning** about possession that requires **critical thinking** and analysis [Result 0]. They may present scenarios with competing claims, nuanced ownership, or require evaluation of trade-offs [Result 0]. The significance lies in assessing **higher-order cognitive skills** such as critical analysis, synthesis, and judgment related to ownership or association [Result 0]. Advanced questions assess knowledge gained from extensive experience and require critical thinking to analyze complex situations, often presenting scenarios with multiple variables.

Machine learning models, such as xgboost, have shown high accuracy in classifying questions by difficulty level, outperforming conventional statistical methods. These models can identify significant variables like answer rate, question type, and solution time that correlate with difficulty. Such approaches can serve as an auxiliary tool for recommending suitable questions to learners.
