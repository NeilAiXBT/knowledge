### The MECE Principle for Question Classification

The **MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)** principle is a fundamental framework utilized for organizing information and problems into distinct and complete categories [previous_tasks:Task 0, previous_tasks:Task 8]. This powerful approach ensures that all information is covered without any overlaps or omissions, which is crucial for clear and comprehensive analysis [previous_tasks:Task 0, previous_tasks:Task 8]. For classifying outputs, such as questions about running, **Mutually Exclusive (ME)** means that each question belongs to one and only one category, preventing any ambiguity or duplication across levels [previous_tasks:Task 0, previous_tasks:Task 8]. **Collectively Exhaustive (CE)** signifies that all possible questions within the scope are included in one of the defined categories, leaving no relevant question unclassified [previous_tasks:Task 0, previous_tasks:Task 8].

Applying the **MECE** principle to question classification involves defining categories so that each question fits into a single level, such as basic, intermediate, or advanced, and ensuring that all relevant questions are assigned to one of these levels [previous_tasks:Task 0, previous_tasks:Task 8]. For instance, a question cannot simultaneously be classified as both basic and intermediate [previous_tasks:Task 8]. This method ensures a structured, rigorous, and effective methodology for breaking down complex problems and information. An analogy for **MECE** classification is organizing files into folders: each file must go into one and only one folder (mutually exclusive), and no files should be left unsorted (collectively exhaustive) [previous_tasks:Task 0, previous_tasks:Task 8]. This structured approach helps in identifying and solving problems more quickly and effectively, providing clearer insights and better decisions.

### Defining Question Levels

Question levels are defined to categorize the cognitive complexity and depth of understanding required to answer them, ensuring a progressive development of knowledge and critical thinking skills [previous_tasks:Task 3]. There are three distinct levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced [previous_conversation].

#### Basic Question Level

**Basic-level questions** focus on simple, factual information and fundamental concepts, aiming to assess familiarity with core elements of a given subject [9:235, previous_tasks:Task 3]. These questions typically require direct, concrete answers and are often closed-ended, although they can be open-ended if the focus remains on foundational comprehension [35:315, previous_tasks:Task 3]. They serve as the foundational building blocks for more complex learning by establishing essential knowledge [9:235, previous_tasks:Task 3]. Examples include "What is the definition of…?", "Who did…?", "When did… occur?", or "How much/many?". For instance, a basic question about running might ask, "What is running?".

#### Intermediate Question Level

**Intermediate-level questions** move beyond simple recall, evaluating a user's ability to understand concepts, apply knowledge, and perform basic analysis [9:236, previous_tasks:Task 3]. These questions often delve into the underlying principles, relationships, and contextual aspects of a topic, frequently employing "How" and "Why" inquiries that demand explanation or reasoning [9:236, previous_tasks:Task 3]. They require integrating existing knowledge to accomplish tasks like planning, designing, or explaining how a service or concept functions. Intermediate questions act as a bridge between merely knowing facts and the ability to apply or analyze them [9:236, previous_tasks:Task 3]. For instance, an intermediate question might be, "What are the physiological determinants of long-distance running performance?".

#### Advanced Question Level

**Advanced-level questions** assess profound understanding, critical thinking, and extensive experience with a topic, often involving complex scenarios with multiple variables [9:237, previous_tasks:Task 3]. These questions demand high-level cognitive skills such as analysis, evaluation, and synthesis, prompting individuals to weigh trade-offs and think critically [9:237, previous_tasks:Task 3]. They are designed to gauge critical thinking and problem-solving abilities in intricate or novel situations, rather than just encyclopedic knowledge. An example of an advanced question could be, "What is running economy and why is it critical for performance?" [17:297, previous_tasks:Task 6].

An analogy for these question levels is cooking: **basic questions** are like checking the ingredients in a recipe, **intermediate questions** involve understanding how to combine and use those ingredients, and **advanced questions** are akin to creating a new recipe or adapting one to a specific occasion [previous_tasks:Task 3].
