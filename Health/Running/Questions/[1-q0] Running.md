### Understanding Running: A Comprehensive Guide

Running is a fundamental form of human locomotion characterized by a moment where both feet are off the ground, distinguishing it from walking where one foot always maintains contact with the ground. It involves rapidly propelling oneself forward on foot. Running engages the body in mainly sagittal movements, with arms and legs moving forwards, but also includes rotational components as leg joints stabilize body weight. This activity demands greater balance, muscle strength, and joint range of movement compared to walking. It is a high-impact activity, with ground reaction forces at the center of pressure increasing up to 250% of body weight during the gait cycle. Running can be aerobic, involving sustained pace and consistent energy use, or anaerobic, involving high-intensity bursts using stored muscle energy without oxygen.
